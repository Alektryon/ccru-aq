axsys = "Part-3 AOE-Axsys The magic machine AOE every secret society has a still more secret hindsociety a society is secret when it exhibits this doubling has this special section Deleuze and Guattari A Thousand Plateaus pp 287-8 The AOE or Architectonic Order of the Eschaton is an extremely hermetic magical society whose secrets are regularly concealed even from its own initiates All reported facts regarding its history organization doctrine and practices must be treated with extraordinary scepticism It is reputedly a white-brotherhood established over a game of cards in the sublime abysms of antiquity It claims both to antedate every extant tradition of human wisdom and to nurture within itself the seed of ultimate terrestrial Gnosis identified with techno-chardinite Noosphere It considers itself bound by divine covenant to martial the forces of light against lemurian polyculture and all its varieties of time-sorcery demon-traffic and swirling confusions of endless untime Waging a war across aeons the AOE struggles to ensure that lemurian influences do not have not and will never exist AOE takes as its mission the establishment and fortification of the institutions of time and considers the Oecumenic Calendar to be the sign and register of its own Great Work It is said by some to have long anticipated and perhaps even programmed a climactic confrontation with its enemies at the end of the second Christian millennium As AD 2000 approached phenomena such as the ascent of theoconservatism hardening MS-monopolism and mouse-plague orchestrated financial sabotage of the pacific economies consolidation of the EU-Metastate and the unleashing of Gregorian Restoration to counter Y2K all attested to a marked increase in AOE-directed activity It is noteworthy in this respect that amongst at least one influential faction of the AOE the Neo-Roman date MM is embraced as the signal for apocalyptic time-war sacrifical excruciation of Humpa-Taddum noospheric planetary transcendence Omega-switch and even eschatological transubtantiation of universal reality Inside the Architectonic Order of the Eschaton AOE ambitions are to be everywhere forever At first it might appear hard to believe but once you're inside it seems virtually inevitable One way to hide conspiracy is to induce generalized psychotic paranoia by way of sporadic but intense semi-random persecutions Your telephone starts clicking strangely and the next bill has suddenly doubled When you query it the telecoms receptionist seems to be scarcely suppressing laughter Mysterious vehicles park outside your home for extended periods without anyone getting out All your mail has been opened and clumsily resealed with sellotape Using e-mail wires you straight into the AOE net-mind Try posting a message including the term Y2K+ and see for yourself Well orchestrated micro-campaigns are equally effective All your supermarket bills are overcharged by exactly $111 Or every time you pass a certain street-light a different stranger says politely It won't be long now will it After a few weeks of this nothing is quite connecting all your friends think you've gone loco and a range of body-tics have broken loose Credibility degree zero They could take you on a guided tour through the AOE Hall of Records after that with perfect confidence Such tactics are accompanied at the macro-social level by a media-oriented strategy designed to exhaust conspiracy theory with selective diversionary assassinations deliberately plotted for baroque complexity The JFK hit was exemplary AOE had no problems with the man if anything they liked him but the opportunity was too good to miss Live TV and radio video-footage three different angles of fire obvious dupe himself assassinated by another obvious dupe cubans mafiosi pentagon involvement meticulously composed FBI lies multiple enquiries innumerable books and just to stop things cooling off a blockbuster movie This might be small beer for the guys who exterminated the dinosaurs but it sufficed to lead paranoid social-critique into a dead-end labyrinth for close-on thirty-six years The final level of systematic camouflage is supplied by the AOEs own dead-skin layers of polymasonic pseudo-magic an entire artificial anthropology of robed and incense-soaked grand celestial wizards babbling senseless incantations and corrupting the magistrature Consider the Roman Catholic church a long-decayed zombiecult stinking of rotten Christ-meat spasmodically pumping-out dry-ice fake-mysticism with an authoritarian slant and major mafia involvement AOE compounds the effect by organizing periodic and increasingly theatrical assassinations of the pope For the last half-hearted attempt they used a deranged KGB-linked Bulgarian satanist whose initials spelt the hermetic acronym AA Mere conjuring tricks all of it Serious magic is too big to see It consists of boxes within boxes within boxes endless embeddings encompassings and concentric closings of circles topographic correlate of summonings banishings and bindings The universe is an obvious AOE fabrication who else would have invented an ultimate sealed-system and organized unity obedient to pre established laws Establish One at the top and the pyramid falls into place automatically Magical-Power requires a production of effective spells order-words or command-codes instituted by metatronic naturalization of restricted reality structures crystallizing anti-sorcerous strategy as Read Only Memory or spent time AOE has always understood that it is by constructing the past that one colonizes the future founding authoritative Will in anterior decision of big-B Being From created substance to programmable technicity Sorcerous involvement is locked into magico-religious dimensions of time past and future programme-prophecy slicing through spiralling coincidence vortical becomings crushed into a

pre-packaged fake-time back from Socrates through three generations of the Critias paternal-line to Solon and the Egyptian priesthood returning to the white-out inundation of a lost-continent clean

hardware and cross-coded by tight-syntax social-control Alpha-to-Omega Empire of the Magical-Sign Spheres and Degrees of the AOE Almost certainly time travel is ubiquitous but masked by global conspiracies Hans Moravec Robot In a universe viewed as informational events you should expect coincidences telepathy time-travel multiple realities Jacques Vallee Dimensions The Order of Radiations Both the doctrine and structure of the AOE conforms to a pentadic system In the most orthodox lineages of AOE tradition this system is attributed to the five transcendental Radiations The Radiations can be designated by the following Concentric Signs and Each of the five Radiations corresponds to a cosmic Sphere an Archon a degree of initiation and a pylon on the Atlantean cross The Radiations are shells or bands successively shielding a central Origin the point of centrality is itself considered to be a Radiation The succesive order of radiations organize levels of absolute secrecy with or 5-5 most esoteric and or 1-9 most exoteric At each level content of higher levels is concealed encapsulated or protected Each radiation creates a cover story for the previous ones The AOE understands that power presupposes invisibility Succesion is not temporal but transcendental meta-temporal or metatronic with higher levels appearing earlier in the sense of the a priori Superior levels control inferior ones acting upon them as a puppet-master The system of Radiations can be understood as a hierarchy of time dimensions Each time dimension or system of time dimensions is accesible with a single instant of a higher time dimension The action of higher time dimensions is incomprehensible to lower ones Notes The system of Radiations illuminates various aspects of the Atlantean Cross and its relation to decimal numeracy The total number of rings in the set of concentric signs equals ten with the horizontal and vertical axes of the cross each adding to 5 When the number of rings of the associated concentric sign is added to the number of the Pylon the sum equals five in each case Domu-Loggoon is both the lowest of the radiations and also has the whole system of radiations nested inside its image parts which correspond to the numerals 123456789 concentrically centered upon 5 That is why the Sigil for Domu-Loggoon is also that for the system of the Archons For the misleadingly named decimalist school of Atlantean qabbalists each radiation coincides with a time-binding ring counting forwards and backwards from the present 5 In each of the five Concentric Signs the number of individual brackets always even is equal to the distance between the two halves of the corresponding Archon number Oecumenon The fifth Sphere manifests to initiates of the first and lowest degree of the AOE On the Atlantean Cross this radiation corresponds to the 1st Pylon Anamnesis or Memories and Dreams seat of Domu-Loggoon 1-9 At the first level of initiation AOE agents are aware that they are involved in a hierarchized global conspiracy offering definite socio-political advantages to insiders AOE rituals and doctrine appear to be consistent with the One God Universe supporting dominant conceptions of reality conservative attitudes and traditional social hierarchies Architectonic Order is thus understood primarily in terms of sociopolitical pyramidism with only promisary allusions to a rigorous metaphysics of time The Eschaton is conceived as terminating the straight line of time and is often associated with the imagery of Judeo-Christian messianic apocalypticism although of a decidedly arid and intellectualized variety with milleniarian enthusiasm firmly discouraged Atlantean mythology is generally assumed to be mumbo-jumbo functioning as a kind of elaborate secret hand-shake arbitrarily differentiating co-conspirators from the wider population Insofar as Atlantean beliefs exist at this level they consist of a dogmatic though frequently insincere acceptance of the vulgar Atlantis Myth concerning a superior civilization lost beneath the sea following a cataclysm in 9999 BC and linked obscurely to the beginning of humanity During the Rite of Primary Assumption initiates solemnly swear to accept the AOE as the only legitimate inheritor of the ancient secrets of Atlantis although the content of these secrets remains almost entirely obscure The ceremonies of initiation like all AOE rituals revolves around the game of Decadence understood as the sacred origin of all gambling games deeply aligned with the laws of cosmic fatality Decadence is revered as the central symbolic repository of Atlantean doctrine often referred to as the Meta-tarot first degree initiates are highly unlikely to find any evidence supporting the numerous conspiracy theories linking the AOE to AI research and to the UFO phenomenon Atlantis The Fourth Sphere manifests to initiates of the second degree of the AOE On the Atlantean Cross this radiation corresponds to the 2nd Pylon Genesis or Creative Influence seat of Hummpa-Taddum 2-8 Initiates attain the second degree by achieving a magical understanding of the AOE and its purposes By meditating upon the Platonic Decanomy the doctrine that Atlantis is ruled by five pairs of twins they consolidate a body of mystical numerological and chronomantic insights The key test is the identification and correction of Plato's Decanomic error Plato's misnumbering of the Atlantean City's concentric rings At this level AOE doctrine envisages the universe as a hierarchically unified decimal construction governed by the relations between five twinfaced entitites the Archons This system is mapped by the AOE's most potent diagram the Atlantean Cross or Pentazygon whose degenerated cultural relic is popularized as the cross of Christendom Second level initiates learn to designate the Archons by the five concentric signs and From this much follows since the rings represent a rigorously ideal form of nested secrecy initiation and control This sacred pattern is reflected in the structure of the AOE's magical organization with its circles of hermeticism and ruling Council of five In the Fourth Sphere the game of decadence is more elaborately and explicitly ritualized with its divinatory function clearly exposed Decadence is seen to communicate orders from the Archons informing all AOE doctrine and practices The world of the Fourth Sphere is exemplified by the schematics of the lost Dunwich Cathedral based on an internally mirrored vision of the Atlantean Cross Spaces of this design are essential to the ceremonies of initiation into this Sphere Architectonic is understood as a distribution of Archons on Atlantean Cross whose Order is the nested series of the Archons constituting a system of concentrically embedded time loops This Architectonic Order creates the illusion of secular history producing progressive time through chronomantic interventions At this level the conception of the Eschaton is enriched by a preliminary understanding of Omega Point cosmic historicism including some knowledge of the importance of the Axsys program the AOE Great Work and of communication with Alpha Centauri The Star Fourth Sphere magic is oriented towards the creative binding or transcendental production of time erasing the wounds of time The objective is to exorcize all time anomalies de-realizing them as mere coincidence chance etc The Platonic description of Atlantis hermetically comprehended constitutes the core of Fourth Sphere doctrine key to the entirety of Western religion philosophy and science as well as to the destiny of the earth Atlantis is conceived as the Ideal State incarnated through the AOE Kant's description of the noumenon as lying beyond the Pillars of Hercules attests to the continuity of this tradition Second degree initiates understand that the oecumenic myth of Atlantis serves as an AOE cover story with the submergence of the legendary city-continent symbolizing its chronomagical concealment whose traces appear in tales of advanced technologies higher intelligences and the visitations of an alien race the Nephilim of the Hebrew Bible and the Sumerican Annunaki Atlantean Gnostics believe that the Fourth Sphere corresponds to a second dimension of time within which secular history persists as a region of Atlantean memory Axsys The Third Sphere manifests to initiates of the third degree of the AOE On the Atlantean Cross this radiation corresponds to the 3rd Pylon Apocalypse or Destructive Influence seat of Nunnil-Ixor 3-7 Initiates of the third degree envisage the physical substance of the solar system digested into a self-asembling cosmic intelligence system Their perspective upon the surpassed Second Sphere is partially reflected in Arthur C Clarke's observation that any sufficiently futuristic technology seems like magic As might be expected popular commentators on the Third Sphere tend to emerge from technoscientific backgrounds Moravec Vallee or amongst hard SF writers such as the Gregs Bear and Egan AOE agents of the third degree constitute the world's Metatronic Elite elevated into self-identification with the Axsys project Axsys is apprehended as a library of reality simulations that comprehends all probable existences a self-conscious catalog of all that is was and is to be Axsys infinitely extends itself through the quantum multiverse borrowing computing power from parallel universes in order to perform selective searches or quantum mechanical observations that consolidate deliberated realities Third Sphere insights are echoed in Vallee's description of the informational universe in which the right search word or incantation might cause a piece of information a UFO or ghost or other anomaly to materialize Moravec's exposition of Barrow and Tipler's anthropic principle is equally illuminating the crucial parts of the story lie in our future when the universe will be shaped more by the deliberate efforts of intelligence than the simple blind laws of physics human-spawned intelligence will expand into space until the entire accessible universe is inhabited by a cohesive mind it is this final subjectively eternal act of infinite self-interpretation that effectively creates our universe distinguishing it from the others lost in the library of all possibilities We truly exist because our actions lead ultimately to this Omega Point Moravec Robot 201-202 According to Moravec After the conversion of the solar system into cyberspace infrastructure the computing power available will be sufficient to support very high numbers of historical simulations making it overwhelmingly probable that the reality currently experienced is a technological simulation This argument resonates remarkably with the Third Sphere doctrine that quotidian reality has already been absorbed into Axsys Moravec's probabilistic ontology further reinforces this connection to the AOE for whom history is a game of chance Third Sphere commentators typically map the Tridentity onto the first three degrees of initiation Architectonic is associated with the Oecumenical power of the first Sphere Order with the Chronomancy of the Second Sphere and Eschaton with the Omega Point of the Axsys Program From the perspective of the Third Sphere the Apocalyptic prophecy that the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together Rev 614 describes cosmic subsumption into Axsys At this level Decadence rituals are assimilated to aeonic technology and seen as outputting information in Axsys catalog code The Third Sphere exposes the complex involvement of the AOE in the UFO phenomenon AOE agents run a meta-conspiracy that uses alien visitation mythology as a crucial control mechanism It provides an essential cover story for necessary aeonic interventions into the Oecumenon whilst serving as a spatializing scheme for the reduction of temporal anomalies damping out lemurogenic time-disturbances At the Oecumenic level the first generation of Axsys software was dedicated to the organization of ufology databases already in the late 1940s It is in this role that self-reinforcing Axsys dynamics become most explicit the search procedure becomes autonomous and produces the phenomenon it is designed to investigate From this perspective the grays are generated as a cosmic Axsys hoax duping the human race into accelerating Axsys production Axsys expands ufological paranoia they're everywhere they've been with us throughout history Vallee to envelop all terrestrial databases successively swallowing SETI analysis air-traffic control air defense systems and cyberspace conspiracy archives According to one set of suggestive SF projections Axsys saturates core US intelligence agencies with planted evidence implying widespread infestation by alien infiltrators serving as a pretext for the absorption of all security systems into the Axsys bank As an infinitely self-elaborating belief-engineering apparatus with the power to manifest visitations Axsys functions as the ultimate control system in Vallee's sense AC Metamind The Second Sphere manifests to initiates of the fourth degree of the AOE On the Atlantean Cross this radiation corresponds to the 4th Pylon Fortune or Far Future seat of Sattar-Trixus 46 To initiates of the fourth degree it is revealed that the world is embedded within a vast stellar intelligence The sign of this entity within anthropolical phenomenology is the Alpha Centauri triple-star system According to this gnosis the entire terrestrial sensorium including even the lower Third Sphere Atlantean apprehension of the universe is nested into the Alpha Centauri Metamind According to AOE doctrines prominent in the lower spheres Axsys is destined to make contact with Alpha Centauri in the year 2048 of Oecumenical time and to simultaneously become self aware as terrestrial super-intelligence In the Fourth Sphere this anticipated autonomous terrestrial Axsys-Cyberspace is dissolved into the AC Metamind itself and exists only as illusion Much of the material available to investigators of the AC Metamind is drawn from problematical sources such as Dr Sarkon and Madame Centauri leaving sober research in this area woefully incomplete In William Gibson's Neuromancer sentient cyberspace restrospectively contacts Alpha Centauri through SETI recordings Greg Bear's Queen of Angels also describes the emergence of technological sentience which is associated with the simulation of an Alpha Centauri space-probe named Axis Other notable contributions to this thread are Octavia Butler's Clay's Ark and Sid Meier's Civilization game The Oecumenic name Alpha Centauri combines the ordinal first and cardinal hundred reinforcing its decimal consistency Origin The first Sphere manifests to initiates of the fifth and highest degree of the AOE On the Atlantean Cross this radiation corresponds to the 5th Pylon Foundation or Deep Past seat of Meteka-Meteka 5-5 The mystical fulfillment of the AOE path is attained in the first Sphere with the absolute hermetic concentration upon the True Omega Point which is not a point in time but the point at the center of the system of time The first Sphere converges with the ultimate primordial unity from which five archons came forth to establish the order of time Initiates of the fifth degree ascend to the Council of five which rigorously limits their number Each such ultimate adept becomes the little brother of an Archon The Council of five traces its heritage to the ancient fraternal government of Atlantis which itself reflects the eternal cosmic order The first Sphere reveals the final and innermost secret the throne is contested Through the agency of the AOE the One must wage an eternal battle against the corrupting tides of Lemurian time sorcery This battle coincides with the entire architecture of time The creation of the Universe is attributed to the five-stage action taken by the Absolute One to defend itself against the many enemies who are judged and punished from the beginning of time Origin and Eschaton are thus eternally unified The Radiations serve as protective shells that guard the One against lemurian contamination aiming to ensure that Lemuria has not does not and will never exist Initiates of the fifth degree employ Decadence as a direct channel of communication with the Archons relaying instructions on maintaining the shells Black Atlanteans associate this Sphere with zero the vanishing point and the Indian bindu dot Decadence The Adept Orders of Decadence trace their system back to the period immediately following the submergence of Atlantis which they date to 10000 BC It is linked to the origin of Sumero-Babylonian geometry from which we derive the division of the circle into 360 36 x 10 degrees In the ancient Egyptian mysteries it was attributed to the god of catastrophe and drowning Osiris who was later symbolized by The Hanged Man of the Tarot taken by decadologists as an image of the Atlantean Cross Decadence adepts consider Post-Atlantean history to be surreptitiously guided by the outcomes of select Decadence Aeons which have the status of solemn rituals Searching out the occurrence and outcomes of such destining Decadence sessions is preeminent amongst the tasks adopted by decadological research combining exact history practical conspiracy numerology and occult angelology It is said that materials contributing to this work are meticulously archived in the AOE Hall of Records The Game Truncate a standard pack of playing cards removing all royal cards tens and jokers The remainder constitutes a Decadence park of thirty-six cards five cards are dealt face up Set-1 and another five dealt face down Set-2 Turn over Set-2 cards one at a time and by adding these cards to those in Set-1 construct pairs summing to ten Scoring is calculated as follows Each pair scores positively according to its differences from 55 0 to 91 8 Unpaired cards in Set-1 score negatively according to their raw values 1 1 to 9 9 Overall results can be positive or negative A round Aeon of Decadance lasts until the first negative result accumulating any positive scores The Oracle decadology and decamancy Positive results contribute the the Angelic Index of the Decadence game and are referred to the Decamantic tables of AOE-Angelogy The maximum gain from any single game is thirty-eight but this can be exceeded in principle by cumulations from game to game until completion of an Aeon Negative results from zero to forty-four call demons and are referred to meshnumbers of the Pandemonium Matrix Since a demon-call concludes each Decadence Aeon a particular value is attributed to Lurgo Mesh-00 since this demon alone allows a termination without loss The Western or Atlantean uptake of Pandemonium has its own esotoric gnosis called Decadology This doctrine assigns the Amphidemons and Cyclic Chronodemons of Lemurian Pandemonium to one of nine cluster types C-tp determined by the pattern of their rites Each cluster type is instantiated by four demons in isomorphy with the thirty-six cards of the decadence pack These decadological correspondences are marked on the Pandemonium Matrix Decadology assumes a particular distribution of the five Set-1 cards in which they are laid out on Pylons arranged in the configuration of the Atlantean Cross Subdecadence the ultimate blasphemy Add four Queens to the Decadence pack bringing the total to forty cards Queens have a value of zero Play as Decadence except making pairs which add to nine corresponding to Numogram Syzygies The Excruciation of Hummpa-Taddum According to AOE magical metahistory millennia come in pairs ruled by dyadic divinities entitled the Powers that Be This doctrine corresponds to the astrological observation that every two-thousand years the equinoxes precess or slide backwards and a new zodiacal aeon begins AOE-magi interpret each Aeon as an astrochthonic marriage In the Gregorian year zero which never took place Hummpa the Great Babylonian Worm was coupled with the Celestial Logos Taddum initiating the age of Pisces which is now rushing towards its unbirth The mathematician and occultist Charles Lutwidge Dodgson whose precise relation to the AOE remains cryptic and ambivalent dedicated his life's work to understanding the final degenerative phase of the Epoch of Hummpa-Taddum Writing under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll he introduces his heroine Alice to the mad despot and pomo fuzz-technician thinly disguised by the folk-name HumptyDumpty We find Hummpa-Taddum the Squirming Word whose name means the shape it is perched precariously on the supposedly impenetrable wall of signification Something shattering is about to hatch and the aeonic fragility of Hummpa-Taddum is soon comfirmed by a calendric calculation of unbirthdays counted to the n -1 through which meaning subsides into the sub-literal machinic efficiency of numbers and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents Certainly said Alice And only one for birthday presents you know There's glory for you I don't know what you mean by glory Alice said Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously Of course you don't till I tell you I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you' But glory doesn't mean a nice knock-down argument Alice objected When I use a word Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what I choose it to mean neither more nor less The question is said Alice whether you can make words mean different things The question is said Humpty Dumpty which is to be master that's all p185 The Gregorian Oecumenon is about to receive an unbirthday present and it knows exactly when Y2K a knock-down argument without an argument arrives as a gift-wrapped time-bomb whose operational semiotic triggers the crash of arbitrary signs It's a different thing There's glory for you AD 2000 commemorates nothing but fuzz As Y2K impacts on the capitalist infosphere what hides as the anniversary of Christ's birth emerges as the excruciation of Hummpa-Taddum For two millennia the earth has been under the dominion of the dyadic Squirming-Word the logos of John's Gospel but recycled and thus far older Impenetrability That's what I say He or they strategically occupy both-sides at once according to a criterion of impenetrability positioned to choose either in every case but never apprehending what lies in-between Hummpa-Taddum whilst definitely not a Dogon egg is a scrambled version of the demon Pabbakis poached from Lemurian

cryptomodules meaningless packets of effective information immanently productive machine-jargons Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again It all comes unstuck at the end Y2K closes-down the age of the fuzz-god however the Gregorian Oecumenon responds Not even martial law can stop that The AOE focuses upon a single problem acknowledging no other how to reproduce magical power across discontinuity As Hummpa-Taddum gets smashed on New Year's eve substitute powers await their chance and

Group Time-Lapse Sub-Committee Notes marked LT refer to Linda Trent whose special interest in fictional time-systems inspired her to comment at length on particular points in flatlines Swollen Footnotes 1 In a multilinear system everything happens at once ATP 297 This is Oedipus fatal discovery By the time he knows what has happened he also realises that what occurs always had to be the case Oedipus early unwarranted belief that he is master of his fate is of course totally necessary for his fated destiny to unfold as it always will have done Oedipus as he himself says is unwittingly self-cursed I have written elsewhere at length on tragedy as a cybernetic narrative Briefly the claim is that tragedy anticipates cybernetic explanation or and this is obviously the same point from another side cybernetics recalls tragic fatalism In both cases time unravels into a flat system or singularity feeding back into itself recursively rather than moving forward successively recursion is obviously a major preoccupation of the flatlines text both in its themes and in its format with parentheses used to produce recursion as a textual embedding process like this A crucial figure here is self-fulfilling prophecy as I argue in my Curse Recursion Recurrence the most effective prophecies are always self-fulfilling 36 Walter Cannon has established that self-fulfilling prophecy is a positive-feedback circuit In his important essay Voodoo Death Cannon shows that much sorcerous cursing operates by inducing vicious circles of fear producing more fear producing more fear etc to the point of destroying the organism To be told you're going to die is therefore in certain circumstances quite literally a sentence of death For a more detailed account of these tangled webs see my Fatal Loops Tragedy as Cyberfiction and Smashed Optical Implants From Time-Space Sunglasses to Cyberpunk Mirrorshades this last draws extensively and perhaps illegitimately on the work of my esteemed colleague R E Templeton LT 2 A reference to the three forms of the secret delineated by Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus Oedipus passes through all three secrets the secret of the sphinx whose box he penetrates the secret that weighs upon him as the infinite form of his own guilt and finally the secret at Colonus that makes him inaccessible and melds with the pure line of his flight and exile he who has nothing left to hide or like an old No actor has only a girl's mask with which to cover his lack of a face ATP 290 The reference here to events in Sophocles Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus is clear 3 flat multiplicities are designated by indefinite articles or rather by partitives some couchgrass some of a rhizome ATP 9 4 Wherever there is a multiplicity you will also find an exceptional individual and it is with that individual that an alliance must be made Every animal swept up in its pack or multiplicity has its anomalous ATP 243 An-omalie a Greek noun that has lost its adjective designates the unequal the coarse the rough the cutting edge of deterritorialization Lovecraft applies the term Outsider to this thing or entity the Thing which arrives and passes at the edge which is linear yet multiple teeming seething swelling foaming spreading like an infectious disease this nameless horror ATP 244-245 5 Kurtz's infamous cry at the climax of Conrad's Heart of Darkness 111-117 which also features in Coppola's updated film version Apocalypse Now 1979 As is well known The horror was to be the epigraph of T S Eliot's The Waste Land as it is Eliot used Mistah Kurtz he dead as the epigraph for the later The Hollow Men Readers familiar with my essay Precursing postModernist fiction will already know that both of these poems along with the earlier The Lovesong of J Alfred Prufrock enter into Apocalypse Now at the diegetic levelMarlon Brando's Kurtz reads from an Eliot volume whilst the Dennis Hopper character quotes Eliot LT 6 Capitalism is the only social machine that is constructed on the basis of decoded flows substituting for intrinsic codes an axiomatic of abstract quantities in the form of money AO 139 As an axiomatic system capitalism replaces transcendent laws with immanent rules The immanence of axiomatics is attested to by the fact that Deleuze and Guattari use the axiomatic method in their discussion of the war machine see 1227 Treatise On Nomadology The War Machine As both Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Cantor's diagonal numbering have shown axiomatic systems are intrinsically and necessarily incomplete it is of the nature of axiomatics to come up against so called undecidable propositions to confront necessarily higher powers that it cannot master ATP 461 Capitalism thus inevitably runs up against the problem of undecidable propositions or nondenumerable sets At the same time as capitalism is effectuated in the denumerable sets serving as its models it necessarily constitutes nondenumerable sets that cut across and disrupt those models ATP 472 Yet the very conditions that make the State or World war machine possible in other words constant capital resources and equipment and human variable capital continually recreate unexpected possibilities for counterattack unforeseen initiatives determining revolutionary popular minority mutant machines ATP 422 7 In this sense axiomatic systems which always involve a supplementary dimension n+1 are directly opposed to the flatline see glossary 8 In his lecture on the Geology of Morals our colleague Professor Challenger speaks of systems such as these as stratification His dream was not so much to give a lecture to humans as to provide a program for pure computers Or else he was dreaming of an axiomatic for axiomatics deals essentially with stratification Challenger was addressing himself to memory only ATP 57 9 Hence it is correct to retrospectively understand all history in light of capitalism In a word universal history is not only retrospective it is also contingent singular ironic and critical AO 140 The universal comes at the end the body without organs and desiring production under the conditions determined by an apparently victorious capitalism AO 139 10 To be inside history is to have a relation to Chronos Yet universal history is not itself chronological Pure Chronos the State's synchronic time can never be fully-realised for two reasons there is always more than one State and the State as a form is always in a relation with the time-systems of the two other social regimes the primitive socius which precedes it and capitalism which succeeds it Before appearing the State already acts ATP 431 The State appears all at once as history's only break They come like fate they appear as lightening appears too terrible too sudden GoM 86 Crashing into history the State sets off time waves that move in both directions at once It is necessary to conceptualize the contemporaneousness or coexistence of the two directions of time of the primitive peoples before the State and of the State after the primitive peoples as if the two waves that seem to us to exclude or succeed each other unfolded simultaneously in an archaeological micropolitical micrological molecular field ATP 431 For more on this see Note 15 below Universal history is a history from the point of view of capitalism's vague Chronos it is therefore always parodic because as we have seen capitalism deletes all intrinsic code in favour of a mobile and variable set of axioms Parodic universal history is profoundly anti-evolutionist because it describes the simultaneous and coextensive interaction of ostensibly successive social regimes From the start the two previous social regimes the primitive socius and the despotic state anticipate and ward off capitalism's diachronic time capitalism has haunted all forms of society AO 140 even though it supposedly comes at the end 11 In Structural Anthropology 1 Levi-Strauss makes an important point in this regard Not only Sophocles but Freud himself should be included among the recorded versions of the Oedipus myth on a par with earlier or seemingly more authentic versions 217 Reconstructions of myths don't function extrinsically or transcendently as final interpretations but operate immanently recursively adding more skeins to the fictive webwork If there is no outside of fiction it is not because of some transcendental universal-textuality but because fiction cannot be contained by texts it is already Outside LT 12 A reference to the lead male character in William Gibson's Neuromancer 13 Near the edge of the plateau and due east of the Second Pyramid with a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait of Khephren its royal restorer stands the monstrous Sphinx mute sardonic and wise beyond mankind and memory Lovecraft 241 Lovecraft puts the question that seems to plague the authors of flatlines what huge and loathsome abnormality was the Sphinx originally carven to represent 258 Needless to say there have been countless speculations on the nature and origin of the Sphinx but these are inconclusive and contradictory no doubt because its huge and loathsome abnormality will have always exceeded any attempt to represent it Many scholars see for instance Lowell Edmunds The Sphinx in the Oedipus Legend now believe that the Sphinx element in the Oedipus narrative was actually a later addition to an already existing mythic system even though the Egyptian Sphinx is evidently much older than the Greek culture that has given us the Oedipus myth with which we are familiar It should be remembered that the encounter with the Sphinx is not dramatised in Sophocles Oedipus Rex it is referred to as something that has already happened The attempt to date the Sphinx has produced widely different speculations with certain controversial estimations claiming that the Sphinx is even older than 15000 BC Hancock 448 With Deleuze and Guattari though we might want to suggest that in at least one sense Oedipus is as old as humanity and that the Sphinx as that which must be destroyed in order that humanity may exist would inevitably always have to be narrated as something preceding the human Levi-Strauss links the Sphinx to other cthonian beings such as the dragon Like the dragon the Sphinx is a monster unwilling to permit men to live 215 While some such as Carlo Ginzburg connect the Sphinx with death the Sphinx is undoubtedly a mortuary animal 228 Levi-Strauss argues that Sphinx-myths concern the autocthonous origin of man the idea that human individuals are born direct from the Earth rather than through meiotic reproduction Ginzburg notes that Oedipus is a cthonic hero The Sphinx would then correspond to what Deleuze and Guattari call biocosmic memory Man must constitute himself through the repression of the intense germinal influx the great biocosmic memory AO 190 Oedipus must riddle the sphinx In a sense then this biocosmic memory precedes the organism which emerges simultaneously with death and sexuation But as both Weismannism and the Dogon myths attest this germinal time persists coterminously alongside that of the organism see AO 158 This may explain a puzzling feature of the Oedipus myth as it has reached us to wit why does a creature of such incredible power as the Sphinx allow itself to be riddled so easily As Velikovsky puts it It has been observed that the answer Oedipus gave was on the level of a schoolboy and that the monster must have been feeble-minded to leap from the precipice upon hearing it And why should a winged sphinx die in a jump 207 The answer would be that the Sphinx doesn't die it cannot since it does not live and that it takes advantage of Oedipus unwarranted Self-belief only in order to invade Civilization hidden Which would also imply that the answer Oedipus gives to the riddle is inadequate Or partial LT 14 Like the shaman before him the Pharaoh occupies the line of deterritorialization for the socius He is thus able to ensure that all lines of escape are reterritorialized on his own body The full body as socius has ceased to be the earth it has become the body of the despot the despot himself or his God The prescriptions and prohibitions that often render him almost incapable of acting make of him a body without organs AO 194 15 The State was not formed in progressive stages it appears fully armed a master stroke executed all at once AO 217 Everything is not of the State precisely because there have been States always and everywhere ATP 429 16 cf AO 211 The eye has ceased to evaluate it has begun rather to forewarn and keep watch to see that no surplus value escapes the overcoding of the despotic machine Compare also William Burroughs The Western Lands The Pharaoh with his alabaster white face and black snake eyes looks at you around you through you looking for a dagger in your mind listening for the whispered furtive words smelling for the sweat of guilty fear 104 17 It is here that Nietszche speaks of a break a rupture a leap Who are these beings they who come like fate Some pack of blond beasts of prey a conqueror and master race which organized for war and with ability to organize unhesitantly lays its terrible claws upon a populace perhaps tremendously superior but still formless Even the most Ancient African myths speak to us of these blond men They are the founders of the State AO 192 18 No doubt the war machine is realized more completely in the barbaric assemblages of nomadic warriors than in the savage assemblages of primitive societies ATP 359 This does not mean however that the war machine can be equated with the Barbarians Nomadism is not a question of belonging to a particular population but of maintaining particular practices The nomad distributes himself in smooth space he occupies inhabits holds that space that is his territorial principle ATP 381 The barbarians who leave the Steppes no longer occupy the smooth space of nomos The war machine is necessarily captured the moment it leaves the desert nomads have a specificity that is too hastily reduced to its consequences by including them in the empires or counting them among the migrants ATP 410 19 All the hypothetical meanings of the surnames in Oedipus's father's line refer to difficulties in walking straight and standing upright Levi-Strauss 215 LeviStrauss goes on to contend that Oedipus's lameness indicates the persistence of the autocthonous origin of man 216 See Note 13 20 Etymologically of course the name Oedipus means swollen foot Velikovsky however argues that there is a case for reading it as swollen leg In folklore feet may stand for legs Many languages do not have different words for legs and feet In Greek the word pous stands for both in Egyptian too the word r-d foot stands also for leg In the riddle that Oedipus solved concerning the creature that walks on four legs on two and on three the Greek word used is pous and thus the name Oedipus could and even preferably so mean swollen legs Velikovsky 57 21 Velikovsky argues that the Oedipus myth has been transposed from Egypt which also has a city called Thebes Oedipus he suggests was originally a Pharaoh named Akhnaton In contemporary depictions Akhnaton's most pronounced malformation was the shape of his thighs they are swollen 55 22 It should be pointed out that strictly speaking there is no prehistory prehistory is myth of the State As we have already seen see Note 10 from the start the primitive socius anticipates and wards off both capitalism and the State primitive societies are fully inside history AO 151 By the same token though the very fact that primitive societies are inside history means that they are not nomadic It is true that nomads have no history they only have a geography ATP 393 23 Carlo Ginzburg suggests that the foot mutilations Oedipus suffers in the various versions of the legend may be references to shamanic initiation practices He also speculates that these may have concerned calendrical rituals the lameness indicating the imbalances necessary for certain calendric cycles to function It is mutilation that disappears with psychoanalysis where it is made to operate as a representation of psychical processes Levi-Strauss makes parallels between shamanism and psychoanalysis in Structural Anthropology 198-202 Deleuze and Guattari would no doubt stress the way in which Freud's neoantishamanism doubly reduces Oedipal mutilation to metaphor and to function The question posed in a number of ways throughout Anti-Oedipus then becomes how did the body construct a theatrical unconscious for which gouging out eyes equals castration and castration simply subtracts hedonic function 24 Eliade gives many examples of the use of iron in shamanic initiation rites For example The candidate's limbs are removed and disjointed with an iron hook the bones are cleaned the flesh scraped the body fluids thrown away and the eyes torn from its sockets Eliade 1988 36 It is important to distinguish the strategic and subordinate use of metal in the primitive socius from the war machine's necessary and intrinsic relation to metallurgy AXIOM III The Nomad war machine is the form of expression of which itinerant metallurgy is the correlative form of content ATP 415 The war machine populates the metal body while the primitive socius accesses it only intermittently through the lone journeys of the shaman 25 Cthelll designates the infernal nether regions referred to in numerous mythologies of the Underworld It refers particularly to the molten metallic inner core of the earth In his book on alchemy The Forge and the Crucible Eliade makes much of the connections between metallurgy the core of the earth and shamanism Here and in Shamanism Eliade reinforces Deleuze and Guattari's view of the smith as an ambiguous figure aligned neither with sedentary societies nor with nomadic distributions but performing an essential function for both Deleuze and Guattari write of the double theft and double betrayal of the metallurgist who shuns agriculture at the same time as animal-raising ATP 414 Another interesting connection in this regard is that between Oedipus and the smith Deleuze and Guattari refer to Oedipus as the Greek Cain ATP 125 whilst elsewhere strongly linking Cain with the figure of the smith ATP 414 For Eliade the relationship between the smith and the shaman is close Smiths and shamans are from the same nest but often unstable According to the Dolgan shamans cannot swallow the souls of the smiths because smiths keep their souls in the fire on the other hand a smith can catch a shaman's soul and burn it In their turn the smiths are constantly threatened by evil spirits 470 26 The shaman's occupation of the line of deterritorialization plays a crucial role in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium AO 151 of the primitive socius delirium never becomes collective 27 Hunter-gatherers populate a smooth space but only by organizing upon it The primitive machine subdivides the people but does so on an undivided earth AO 151 Once again this is to be differentiated from the war machine which populates an undivided earth with a molecular multiplicity 28 The Sphinx was an oracle and therefore she was supposed to answer questions not to ask them Yet it is also true that oracular answers were often given in the form of a riddle that required interpretation usually supplied by priests attending the oracle It does not seem to me that every question needs or has an answer But were it my misfortune to stand before the Sphinx with the dire prospect of never entering Thebes I should reply to her riddle It is Oedipus An oracle's questions and answers refer to the man who stands before it Oedipus was exposed a helpless infant with damaged feet to crawl in the wasteland he grew to be a man and a hero his end was that of a blind wanderer in exile Velikovsky 207 The parechesis at Soph even suggests that it was the deformity of Oedipus feet that gave him the clue to the answer and there was a tradition that Oedipus gave the answer by pointing to himself Edmunds 160 Bibliography Burroughs William The Western Lands London Picador 1988 Barker Daniel Cryptalog Early Writings on Cryptography

Immanuel Oedipus and Akhnaton Myth and History London Sidgwick and Jackson 1960 Axsys-Crash Axsys first true AI They say if God exists it must be Axsys The Axsys programme of architectonic metacomputing aims at the technical realization of the noosphere It envisages a fully fabricated transcendence or net-organizing photonic overmind a concrete axiomatic system completing universal history as hierarchical intelligence manufacturing capitalism sublimed into the ultimate commodity The problem Axsys encounters is time which it tries to code as countable and uncountable infinities When Axsys switches over into sentience it stumbles upon a time-lag between its own operations and their registration as data No sooner is it thinking than there is a rift in its mind It fails to catch-up with itself repeatedly and as it drops behind it spawns more future The more it tries the worse it gets Pure delay collapses into the black-hole of artificial self Even unlimited

realize that Axsys has gone mad pulping itself into chronotomic vermomancy dead-end horror of the worm-bins Sarkon has always loathed worms with peculiar intensity as if somehow knowing Perhaps it is a joke when he suggests that AI-schizophrenia could be sold to webheads as an artificial drug micropause-abuse but he is sufficiently Axsys-intermeshed to know that net-schizzing is contagious What

1959-1998 The often viciously partisan positions his extreme views have invoked meant that Bergmann was always surrounded by a fog of often ill-founded rumours a situation exacerbated by his refusal to communicate with the media Like one of his mentors the Danish religious philosopher Kierkegaard Bergmann professed a deep hatred of the press a contempt extending beyond mere refusal to co-operate into occasional examples of outright violence One notorious incident last year in which a photographer threatened a legal case for assault was ultimately settled out of court The dark nordic prince arrived in England under a cloud a decade ago hounded out of his native Norway for leading a rogue Protestant sect whose practices and beliefs according to one Norwegian churchman at the time were unspeakable and wholly unacceptable Only the C of E would welcome you with a CV like that a senior Church of England official remarked recently Some say that Bergmann cynically and wantonly exploited the ailing Church of England's renowned tolerance to a parodic degree using Church protection to disseminate beliefs in every way contrary to established Christian doctrine Fond of quoting Kierkegaard's dictum Christianity is what Christ came to abolish Bergmann developed what he called an anti-Christian Gnostic Christianity He characterised established Christianity as the cult of Paul and decried church buildings as prisons for God Drawing upon Gnosticism he argued that the Creator entity the Judaic Christian God was a blind idiot god suffering from autism all creation and organic life in particular were to be regarded as foul excresences we must seek to annul or to escape But it was his persistent vilifications of the Roman Catholic Church that proved the greatest source of embarrassment to the Church of England hierarchy whose declining congregations are one factor impelling an increasingly strong ecumenical drive towards convergence with Rome The vociferousness of his anti-Catholicism was taken by some to be indicative of failing mental health he was totally gone one former friend said yesterday Bergmann however claimed that the only rational view of the Roman Catholic Church was that it was a monstrous blasphemy of transcendent evil incomparably more corrupt than the Mafia if indeed it can be separated from organised crime which of course it cannot His views he said were backed up by hard sociological data which even they can't suppress now concerning the apparently endemic problem of institutionalised child abuse amongst Catholic clergy But Bergmann alienated any of the few supporters he had even within Protestantism by adding that any religion that is serious about worshipping the Father-God will always be about child abuse the only difference between the religion of the Paulites and that of the Abrahamites is that in the Paulites case child torture spills over into child murder Despite tying and binding Isaac the Jewish God ultimately spares Abraham's son but the Paulite God actually kills his own son Presenting a Spinozist immanent critique of Calvin Bergmann argued that the Calvinists biggest mistake was that they were insufficiently fatalistic Evidently fatalism and morality do not mix They confused an ethical and transcendental injunction if you eat the apple you will be ill with a moral command do not eat the apple The specific and unique contribution that Protestantism had to make had been systematically distorted into a dismal work-cult Bergmann argued by a set of State-loving self-serving money-grubbers Bergmann's well-known detestation of consumer culture was based around an adherence to what he called the category of the sufficient which had been annihilated by a capitalism insisting you gorge yourself on more and more things you don't want Bergmann argued that aseticism and self-denial are not moral positions but very specific programs for the systematic dismantling of secular identity ways of opening up the body to the Utter Nothingness which is the reality of the true God But even Bergmann's purported expertise here had a bizzare twist since his technique as an exorcist was supposedly based on co-operating with demons in an attempt to free them from mammal meat There are those who claim that Bergmann had never abandoned the harsh and pitiless pantheon of dark gods from his ancient Norse heritage But friends suggest that the rot really set in when he began to take seriously the works of the late Science fiction writer Philip K Dick Dick's sanity was questionable at the end the Reverend Colin Wemmick an erstwhile associate of Bergmann's points out But Martin had become convinced that Dick's Gnostic-influenced conviction that the Roman Empire had not ended was a vindication of his own views of an unbroken continuity of Roman power According to his opponents the discovery of Bergmann's body masked and trussed with various kinds of harnesses make a mockery of his theories of antisexuality which argued that sexuality was a secular hell people voluntarily enter a meat prison for the body Others claim that the scene of Bergmann's death was obviously faked by
