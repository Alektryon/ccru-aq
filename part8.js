pandemonium = "Part-8 Pandemonium The system Pandemonium is the complete system of Lemurian demonism and time sorcery It consists of two principal components Numogram time-map and Matrix listing the names numbers and attributes of the demons The system is constructed according to immanent criteria latent in decimal numeracy and involves only basic arithmetical operations assembled from additions and subtractions The Numogram or Decimal Labyrinth is composed of ten zones numbered 0-9 and their interconnections These zones are grouped into five pairs syzygies by nine-sum twinning zygonovism The arithmetical difference of each syzygy defines a current or connection to a tractor zone Currents constitute the primary flows of the numogram Each zone number when digitally cumulated defines the value of a gate whose reduction sets the course of a corresponding channel Channels constitute the secondary flows time-holes or secret interconnections of the numogram The arrangement of currents divides the Maze into three basic time-systems firstly the currents of the three central syzygies mutually compose a cycle rotating in anticlockwise steps Lemurian sorcery calls this inner loop the Time-Circuit Secondly and thirdly in both the Upper and the Lower syzygies the currents produced fold back into a half of themselves constituting autonomous loops the Warp upper and Plex lower Warp and Plex circuitries are of an intrinsically cryptic nature which is compounded by the enigmas of their interconnection They are variously considered to be Outside or Outer-time The gates and their channels knit the Maze together providing connections between otherwise incompatible time-systems They open and close the ways of sorcerous traffic Although each gate deranges time in its own way their operations vary with a certain regional consistency In addition to the twins with their currents and time-systems and the gates with their channels and time-faults there is a third occult thread running through Lemurian time-sorcery that of the distances or of the demons Between any pair of zones however seemingly disconnected or unconnectable they may seem there is an irreducible or hyper distance which Lemurian culture systematically characterizes as a singular entity These entities are simultaneously gaps links holes and demons with particular traits features aspects and potentials Each demon is considered to be intrinsically zygonomous or double-numbered both addressed by a unique zone-net couple of descending value net-span and also called by a mesh-serial which is immanently defined by a sequential matrix 00-44 Each demon also has a tonality or pitch ranging from the highest frequency Ana 7 to the lowest Cth-7 All syzygetic demons have a neutral or Null pitch Since they are proliferated by a digital cumulation to the ninth power the demons are forty-five in number attuning them to the Gate-City of the Plex-channel Utterminus of Cthelll Gt-45 which is identified with the microcosmic lair of all demonic populations the Lemurian Pandemonium According to Lemurian demonism each demon is itself a swarm or singular coalescence but also a component of a larger array which can be sorted by type The three principle demonic groupings are Chronodemons varieties of distance within the time-circuit Amphidemons ruptures in the time-circuit openings to the Outside and Xenodemons denizens of the outer gulfs Demons are also grouped by phase defined by initial net-span digit Each phase is opened by a door to which is attributed a domain a planetary affinity and a spinal level Demons can be characterized by the various rites routes or routines that they draw through the hyper-time of the maze There is a rite for each way in which the net-span of a demon can be integrated in extension or traced across the flows of the numogram Such rites are the basic components of demon traffic constituting modules of practical culture each of which is associated with an omen and a power In Western hyperfictional lore the matrix of all demons Pandemonium is called Necronomicon The Book of Dead Names listing all that is excepted from the whitemagic book of life Necronomicon is a document copied episodically from versions of an original text which was itself retrodeposited out of the future into the deep past It thus scrambles science-fiction with archaic legend indicating a Lemurodigital hypersource The Nomo Chant Nomo Undivided Outside One For You Life is Drowning Nomo Numerous Under One You Part Through Depths Swelling Nomo Half Hidden Within One

committed to an ongoing research program into the numeracy of the lost Lemurian polyculture apparently terminated by the KT missile of BCE 65 000 000 During the last century various aspects of this primordially ancient digital hyperstition mechanomics schizonumerics or numbo-jumbo have been painstakingly re-assembled through certain cryptic investigations pre-eminently those associated with the names Echidna Stillwell Chaim Horovitz and Daniel Barker From the Mu-Archive in Tibet Horovitz unearths an ultimate decimal qabbala oriented to the cultic exploration of the numerals zero-to-nine as cosmic zones In contradistinction to the late-Babylonian or Judeo-Christian qabbala the method of Mu involves a rigorous collapse of transcendent symbolism into intrinsic or immanent features excavating the latent consistency between the numerical figures their arithmetic functions and their cultural associations Horovitz describes these procedures as a diagonal path between esoteric numerology and exoteric mathematics and also defines them negatively as a non-numerology or ulterior-arithmetic Atlanto-Babyonian State-societies preserved some of the most fully degraded lateMuvian conclusions but only by assimilating them to a Gnostic Arithmetic fossilizing the numbers into spiritual beings ideal individuals and general concepts Within these familiar traditions the sense of the numbers as raw functions of cosmic distribution was systematically subordinated to magical and religious principles whilst their intensive potentials as transmutational triggers was drained-off into geometrical structures and logical representations The productive synthesis of Stillwell's numogrammatic researches with Barker's tic-systemic approach provides the requisite cutting-tools for re-opening the virtual-numeric labyrinth This involves the re-activation of those Lemurian cultural practices which traffick with numbers as techno-sorcerous entities the diagrammatic tokens intensive thresholds cosmic coincidences and hyperstitional influences that populate the plane of Unlife II Ccru has collated material from a series of occultural investigations that demonstrate the virtual existence of a lost Lemurian art of interplanetary communication or planetwork This system maps the major bodies of the Solar-system onto the ten digital labyrinth Zones beginning from Sol 0 The numerals one to nine function as astronomical ordinals designating the terms of the planetary sequence in ascending order of orbital span mean distance from the sun orbital period local year length and gravitational attenuation Einsteinean spatial flatness This heliocentrism with its implicit repudiation of terrestrial phenomenology does not contradict the broad counter-solar trend in Lemurian culture with its repulsion of centralization and gravitational capture There has never been a Lemurian solar cult Lemurian Planetwork communicates with the substellar bodies as distributed hyper-intelligences exerting singular influences or Barker-traces These planetary forces of suggestion are propagated through contemporary mythologies systematic coincidences and accidental scientific fictions whether lunar seas martian canals jovian monoliths or life on Europa Various cryptic records indicate the existence of considerable calendrical lore based upon the Planetwork system yet little of this has been definitively reconstructed What is certain is that it takes the mercurian year for its basic unit and uses this regular beat in the calendrical interweaving of nonmetric speeds and slownesses The Zone-Sequence by mercurian periods with planetary attributions Zn-0 000000 Sun Zn-1 000100 Mercury Zn-2 000255 Venus Zn-3 000415 Earth Zn-4 000795 Mars Zn-5 004924 Jupiter Zn-6

particles With Stillwell's epoch-switching discovery of the Numogram and subsequent mapping of this digital labyrinth it became possible to compile cartographies of these zones in which numbers distribute themselves throughout tropics clusters and regions The zones thus function as diagrammatic components of flat cosmic maps variously charting systems of coincidence nebular circulations spinal nestings and the folds of inner-outer time Amongst numerous systematizations of occult cartography that of Chaim Horovitz direct descendant of the infamous mad rabbi of Kiev is especially remarkable Based upon Lemurian digital relics extracted from the Mu-Archive it enables the conversion of numogram-zones and sub-zones into cascade-phases accessed through numerical doors The Horovitzean phases constitute qabbalistic groupings or cross-sections of the pandemonium population simultaneously numbering the impulse-entities and defining their collective tone Those critics who seek to reduce Horovitz's work to an immensely indirect rediscovery of Pascal's triangle fail to appreciate either the true antiquity of Pascal's system or the machinic novelty of it's Horovitzean reanimation Systematic issues concerning the Numogram Gates have been separated out from the other interconnective features of the zones It has been known since the dawn of occult cartography that every Zone supports a Gate and that their corresponding channels spin the web of esoteric fibres All sorcerous cultures involve themselves in the exploration of these paths A Sarkonian mesh-tag is provided for each zone as a key to Axsys-format and Cryptcompatibility Zone Zero The Numeral 0 The modern figure zero 0 is a closed circle oval or ellipse sometimes differentiated from the letter O by a diagonal slash Its archaic Hindu form was the bindu or dot retained in the modern system as the decimal point Both of these ciphers are of such abstraction that no rapid summary can be other than misleading The figure 0 designates the number zero anterior to the distinction odd-even and also to the determination of primes zeroth prime 1 Zero is the only natural number that is indivisible by one The division of any number by zero produces an infinity multiplication of any number by zero 0 in this respect zero treats itself as any other number Zero digitally cumulates to zero Numeric Keypad direction anomalous As an arithmetical function zero is strongly affined to place value or positional systems in which it typically operates as the designator of empty magnitudes The modern decimal and binary systems are the most familiar examples of such modular numeracies The widespread assumption that such a zero-function is indispensable to any possible place-value numeracy is however a fallacious one On the number line zero marks the transition from negative to positive numbers In modern binary code zero is instantiated by electronic off see One In set theory zero corresponds to the null or empty set In coordinate geometry zero marks the origin or intersection point of all dimensional axes and is marked uniquely across all dimensions In game theory a zero-sum game is one in which all gains and losses are mere redistributions I win you lose or inversely In Boolean algebra zero symbolizes logical negation Absolute zero or zero-degrees Kelvin marks the cryonic limit of physically attainable temperature In schizoanalysis zero-intensity designates the planomenon plane of consistency or body without organs immanent to all intensities With no other number does arithmetical function cross so imperceptibly into religious and philosophical abstraction There is a mathematico-cosmic continuum connecting the numeral zero to concepts of nullity nihility nothingness absence emptiness void Hindu Sunya vacuum and neutrality Zero also has an initiatory sense as indicated by the year zero of new beginnings or cycles as in the case of the Y2K 00-date and in that of the zero-strings marking accumulations in the Hindu Yugas A similar function is that of time-zero or zero-hour synchronizing a distributed operation particular one of a military nature The Zeroth Planet Sol The Sun Sol-0 is by far the largest body in the Solar-system It spins on its own axis at different speeds with a period of rotation varying from about 36 Earth-days at the poles to 254 at the equator The sun-spot cycle driven by periodic reversals in the solar magnetoprocess lasts for approximately twenty-two years The Sun is approximately 45 billion years old roughly half-way through it's normal existence or main-sequence of hydrogen-to-helium nucleosynthesis After the completion of this phase it is destined to expand into a Red Giant consuming the inner Solar-system Its current temperature varies enormously according to depth between 5 800 k at the surface to 15 600 000 k at the core The pressure at the Sun's core is equivalent to 250 billion terrestrial atmospheres The preponderance of the Sun's mass within the Solar-system is such that the orbits of the planets notably Jupiter only produce minor perturbations in its behavior Solar radiation sustains all photosynthetic activity on Earth and thus all plantbased terrestrial life Its wide range of complex and ambivalent effects extend from regulating circadian biorhythms to triggering skin-cancers The Sun's magnetic field the heliosphere is immensely powerful by planetary standards extending beyond the edge of the outer Solar-system as defined by the orbit of Pluto Other Solar-influences in addition to gravitational and electomagnetic forces include the solar-wind which also extends on a declining gradient beyond the edge of the solar-system The two predominant aspects of the Earth's mechanical relation to the Sun the day and the year have been the basis of traditional human time-keeping The earliest known clocks were sun-dials Sun-worship is extremely prevalent within human religious history The apparent rotation of the Sun around the zodiac is the keystone of exoteric astrology allocating Sun-signs Oecumenic Sunday is dedicated to Sol System Notes Zone-0 is the first of two zones mutually composing the Plex-region of the Numogram Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-9 This 9+0 Syzygy is carried by the demon Uttunul see Zone-9 Zone-0 provides the terminus for a single Plex-channel the 0th Systematic consistency suggests that Zone-0 envelops the Zeroth-Phase of Pandemonium but as this includes nothing beyond itself it constitutes a nominal or virtual multitude and an absolute abstraction Zone-0 has no separable power of initiation and since it does not support imps or impulse-entities even of the first degree there is no zeroth door The Zeroth Gate Gt-00 seems to connect Zone-0 to itself but its nature is peculiarly problematical and within the Mu-Archive texts its ultimate reality is fundamentally disputed Many versions of the Numogram delete it entirely Horovitz says of this Gate that between its existence and nonexistence there is no difference Mu Tantrism plots Zone-0 intensities onto the Coccygeal level of the spine the vestigial remnant of a lost tail and biotectonic link to the ancient lemur-people Zone-0 is allotted the Sarkonian Mesh-Tag 0000 Lemurian subcultures associate Zone-0 with the dense void of the cosmic hypermatrix upon which absolute desolation crosses infinity as flatline and loss of signal Blind Humpty Johnson's Channel-Zero black snow cult communicate the influence of this zone in their call for the return of true Tohu Bohu or the subprimordial Earth Centauri subdecadence maps Zone-0 onto the eclipsed side of the fifth or Root Pylon on the Atlantean Cross As the dark aspect of Foundation deep past it corresponds to the protocosmic abyss anticipating primal reality fusing indissociably into the ultimate gulfs of chaotic unbeing Stillwell links Zone-0 to the unvoiced Munumese quasiphonic particle eiaoung the silent whisper of the ulterior depths Phase-0 Lemurs Phase-0 tolerates no populations of any kind Zone One The Numeral 1 The figure one 1 elaborated from a simple vertical stroke is at least semi-ideographic as a relic tally-mark basically identical in this respect to the Roman numeral I This figure has obvious phallic resonance especially in contrast to the sign for zero 0 Its relation to the figure seven 7 is supported by numerological analyses since seven cumulated 28 reduces to one The figure 1 designates the number one first odd number with odditude of aleph-null and the zeroth prime first prime 2 One is the lowest cardinal number and the first ordinal One digitally cumulates to one Numeric Keypad direction South-West In modulus-2 systems the numeral one bears all non-zero values corresponding to powers of two Binary informatic systems code electronic on as one The number one is exceptionally multivalent It has two basic cardinal values both deriving from its status as the smallest basic or irreducible factor defining the natural number series that of the elementary the atom the unit or module one alone and also that of the whole the complete unity as totality the universe Its ordinal value as first primary principal or initial is fractured by the ordinal function of zero but retains much of its ancient dignity as the beginning of the counting series In addition one bears a diversity of quasinumerical and logical associations including self-identity oneself one and the same nondifferentitation uniqueness one of a kind logical universality uniformity and at a further remove or more problematically singularity anomaly exception and the unilateral one-sided unbalanced disequilibriated One also has a complicated syntactical-linguistic usage that interlinks with its numerical and logical functions In particular it operates as a carrier of nominal and indefinite reference the one that someone or anyone once upon a time which extends also to relation one another Within monotheistic cultures One attains a supreme dignity identifying God directly with the One or the Old One In this context one is bound to the I am that I am of YHVH and to the absolute concentration of religion within the assertion that there is no God but God H P Lovecraft upsets this exclusive and definitive sense of the One by reintroducing the plural and multiple whether grammatically as in the case of the Old Ones or thematically as in that of Yog Sothoth who is described as the all in one and one in all The first Planet Mercury Mercury is the innermost planet of the Solar-system with a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 58 000 000 km The mercurian year approx 88 Earth-days in length is also the swiftest which accounts for it's use as the base calculative unit in planetwork calendrics Due to it's long day approx 587 Earth-days in length Mercury has semi-permanent light and dark sides with average temperatures of +430 and 180 degrees celsius respectively Mercury has a weak magnetic field approx 1% the strength of Earth's In Roman mythology Mercury a latinization of the greek Hermes is known as the messenger of the gods associated with communication and trade The element Mercury or quicksilver symbol Hg has particular alchemical importance shared in Indian yogic traditions where it is ritually ingested to produce an anorganic cosmic body In Lemurian Planetwork Mercury is astrozygonomously paired with Neptune System Notes Zone-1 is the first of the six Torque-region Zones of the Numogram and TractorZone of the 5-4 or Sink Current Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-8 This 8+1 Syzygy is carried by the demon Murmur see Zone-8 Zone-1 provides the terminus for three Torque-channels the 1st 4th and 7th Zone-1 both initiates and envelops the first-Phase of Pandemonium including 2 impulse-entities This phase consists of nothing beyond the Zone 1 and the Door 10 thus tending to a highly idealized state Zone-1 has a particularly powerful and manifest initiatory dimension The first Door or Door of Doors is attributed by Muvian sorcery to the amphidemon and imp of the first degree Lurgo 10 the Initiator and widely related to Legba the first and last Loa to be invoked in any vudu ceremony The first Gate Gt-01 connects Zone-1 to itself and its corresponding channel provides a reduced microcosmic model of the Torque as a whole in which Zone-1 provides both beginning and end In this respect Horovitz describes Zone-1 turning forever into itself The resulting metastability of this channel accounts for its strong associations with all known variants of the Bubble-Pod mythos Mu Tantrism plots Zone-1 intensities onto the Dorsal or Thoracic level of the spine which maps onto the domain of lunged creatures and colonization of the land Zone-1 is allotted the Sarkonian Mesh-Tag 0001 matching the primordial click of Tzikvik cipher-shamanism Lemurian subcultures associate Zone-1 with metastatic pod-deliria and technoimmortalism It maintains relatively recent religious structures patterned on transcendent-oppressor sky-god divinity as well as harboring the more archaic gnosis of the shelled old one who supports the world turtle cults Centauri subdecadence maps Zone-1 onto the palpable side of the first or Center Pylon on the Atlantean Cross As the light aspect of Anamnesis memories and dreams it corresponds to enduring ideas historical time and remembrance recall Stillwell links Zone-1 to the Munumese quasiphonic particle gl emanating from the sublaryngeal region the Horowitzean collapsed gargle or glottal spasm a relic from lost gilled-gulping life-forms Stillwell's ethno-topography of the Nma allocates Zone-1 to the coral atolls of the Mu Nma and through their hydrocycle mythos to shallow seas Zone-1 totem animals are drawn from the spectrum of armored fish creatures combining a basic icthyoid model with traits extracted from crustaceans mollusks and gastropods Phase-1 Lemurs M00 10 Lurgo Zone Two The Numeral 2 The figure two 2 is quasisymmetric with the figure five 5 This pairing is echoed in the alphabet by the letters Z and S whose shared consistency across case and phonetic coherence has been taken by figural grammarians as indicative of a zygophidian or forked-tongue cultural source The figure 2 designates the number two the first and definitive even number and the first prime second prime 3 The encounter with the irrationality of the square-root of two has special importance in the disturbance of Hellenic rationalistic arithmetic It is rumoured that the Pythagoreans resorted to assassination in their attempt to suppress this discovery Two digitally cumulates to three Numeric Keypad direction South The mechanical importance of bi-stable on-off micro-states within contemporary electronic data-systems has resulted in a vast and diffuse cultural investment in modulus-2 numeracy pure place-value semiotics Digital and binary-coded have now become almost synonymous in their colloquial usage Perhaps the supreme exemplar of a binary-numeric system is that of the ancient Chinese I Ching or book of changes which involves both binary numeracy of broken and unbroken lines and double-numbering of numeric hexagrams tagged by a series of ordinal numbers It is Leibniz's study of this text which elaborates the first Western example of modern binary arithmetic The syzygetic or zygonomous power of two is a productive of an entire series of subtly differentiated binary concepts which include coupling twinning doubling polarity schism contrast balance opposition and reflection Binarity is multiply ambivalent It conspires with both the certainties of analytical reason in general by way of two-value logics governed by the principle of the excluded middle and also the uncertainties of dialogue or two-way communication It is associated equally or unequally with both justice even-handedness seeing both sides of a dilemma and deceit two-faced two-timing double-dealing Duality is particularly widespread within biological order from the base-pairs of RNA and DNA code through the binary fission of bacterial propagation the binary sexual difference of meiotic reproduction to the bilateral symmetry of the typical vertebrate organism with consequent pairing of limbs arms legs senseorgans eyes ears lungs brain-hemispheres etc Dual-organization provides a basic model for primordial human kinship structure Many aspects of binarity are prominent within religious systems whether gods with two heads or faces such as the Roman Janus and the Deleuze-Guattari gods of the State twin gods the Dogon Nommo or the Zoroastrian couple Ahriman-Ormuzd divine couples god-goddess pairings being widespread throughout many religions and twice-born gods both Zeus and Dionysos amongst the Greek pantheon for instance Hindu culture describes Brahmins as twice-born The Second Planet Venus Venus or Sol-2 has a mean orbital distance from sun of 1082 million km The Venusian year is approx 2244 Earth days in length Since the rotation of Venus is very slow and also retrograde a Venusian day lasting 243 Earth-days is longer than its year In recent times Venus has become the exemplary victim of a runaway greenhouse effect which has rendered it infernal with a uniform surface temperature of +462 degrees celsius Venus has no magnetic field Venus has been historically identified by two different names known as the morning star Phosphorous or Lucifer when seen in the East at sunrise and the evening star Hesperus when seen in the West at sunset The Roman goddess Venus a latinization of the greek Aphrodite was the deity associated with female beauty and love accounting in part perhaps for Burroughs hatred of Venusians In Lemurian Planetwork Venus is astrozygonomously paired with Uranus System Notes Zone-2 is the second of the six Torque-region Zones of the Numogram Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-7 This 7+2 Syzygy is carried by the demon Oddubb see Zone-7 Zone-2 both initiates and envelops the Second-Phase of Pandemonium including 4 impulse-entities With cryptic rigor Horovitz thus describes Zone-2 as reduplicating its double-twinness though its multitude As initiator it functions as the Second Door invoked by K-goth cults as the Main Lo-Way into the Crypt Muvian sorcery identifies this door with the amphidemon and imp of the first degree Duoddod 20 The Second Gate Gt-3 connects Zone-2 to Zone-3 and its corresponding channel draws an intense line of escape from the Torque to the Warp This passage is especially compelling since it is multiply consolidated by cumulation prime-ordination and mesh-tagging Tzikvik shamanism both honours and fears the Second Gate as the opening to the way of the Storm-Worm Zone-2 is allotted the Sarkonian Mesh-Tag 0003 Lemurian subcultures associate Zone-2 with crypt-navigation occulted cyberspace and the spectral liminal populations of hallucination and time fragmentation greys ghosts and zombies Zone-2 mirrors Zone-5 and shares in its Hyperborean themes of time-lapse and abduction Centauri subdecadence maps Zone-2 onto the eclipsed side of the Second or Right Pylon on the Atlantean Cross As the dark aspect of Genesis creative influences it corresponds to epidemic fertility bacterial fission clones replicants vampiric contagion Stillwell links Zone-2 to the Munumese quasiphonic particle dt the Horowitzean imploded fricative-fractured plosive Stillwell's ethno-topography of the Nma allocates Zone-2 to the interior marshlands of the Dib Nma and through the Mu Nma hydrocycle mythos to mist vaporization and hazing Zone-2 totem animals are modelled on metamorphic insects principally lepidoptera moths and butterflies but also dragonflies and dibboma flashbugs Phase-2 Lemurs M01 20 Duoddod M02 21 Doogu Zone Three The Numeral 3 The figure three 3 is semi-iconic incorporating a stack of three horizontal strokes It is quasisymmetric with the upper-case letter E and partially echoed in the figure 8 designating the third power of two figural grammarians consider it to involve a progression of compressive folding beyond 1 and 2 The figure 3 designates the number three the second odd number with odditude of 1 and second prime third prime 5 Three is the square-root of nine relating it intimately to Barkerian arithmetic and Zygonovism Three digitally cumulates to six Three is itself the sum of the three preceding natural numbers 0 + 1 + 2 3 demonstrating a unique affinity with numerical triangularity Numeric Keypad direction South-East A peculiarly obsessive triadic numeracy is evidenced in the vulgar zygotriadic calendar of the Mu Nma The number three is unique for both the intensity and diversity of its cross-cutting hyperstitious investments It is associated on the right hand with numerological completeness and transcendence and on the left hand with the middle the between and the diagonal line

towards a triadic order of the world both in the realm of mythology heaven hell limbo and in that of geopolitics first second and third-world The extraordinary numinousness of the number three is also indicated by ethnomes such as tribalism tributaries trickery and trials the three body problem three wishes three fates three graces the third-eye and the arch-magician Hermes Trismegistus Atlantean sources relate the cultural dominance of the number three to the fact that Alpha Centauri is a triple system The Third Planet Earth Earth or Sol-3 has a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 149 600 000 km defining the standard Astronomical Unit AU Its orbital period of approx 3652422 Earth days and rotational period approx 24 hours are used as the basis of terrestrial calendrics along with the period of its satellitic lunar orbit and traditionally for time-keeping now supplanted by atomic clocks The Earth has one moon Luna of abnormal size relative to that of the planet and exercizing considerable influence principally through tidal forces Lunar influences such as that evident in the human ovulatory cycle have consolidated deep cultural associations between the moon oceans women blood sorcery and madness lunacy The Earth is the densest major body in the Solar-system It is polarized by a moderate magnetic field which reverses intermittently once or twice every million years By the end of the second millennium of the Common Era the Earth was still the only known source of life in the Universe Prior to the Copernican revolution in the C16th the Earth was considered to be the centre of the Solar-system and even of the universe by the dominant cultures of mankind an orthodoxy ruthlessly defended by the Christian Church among others Alone amongst the Planets the Earth is not named after a Greek or Roman deity The name Earth is of Anglogermanic origin The Greek goddess Gaia is increasingly evoked as the name for Earth conceived as a living macro-entity provoked in part by systemic or ecospheric changes in climate atmosphere and biodynamics In Lemurian Planetwork the Earth is astrozygonomously paired with Saturn System Notes Zone-3 is the first of the two Warp-region Zones of the Numogram and TractorZone of the 6-3 or Warp Current Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-6 This 6+3 Syzygy is carried by the demon Djynxx see Zone-6 Zone-3 provides the terminus for two channels one each from the Torque the 2nd and the Warp the 6th Zone-3 both initiates and envelops the Third-Phase of Pandemonium including 8 impulse-entities In the first of these aspects it functions as the Third Door which opens onto the Swirl and is attributed by Muvian sorcery to the chaotic xenodemon and imp of the first degree Ixix 30 The Third Gate Gt-6 twists Zone-3 through Zone-6 with its corresponding channel vortically complementing that of the Sixth Gate Gt-21 and also the Warp-Current itself thus adding an increment of spin to the entire region Horovitz invests Zone3 with a particular potency of intrinsic coincidence since its second cumular power 6 is also the number of its Syzygetic double through which he accounts for the compact tension of the Warp system Mu Tantrism plots Warp-region intensities onto the plane of the third-eye Zone-3 is allotted the Sarkonian Mesh-Tag 0007 Lemurian subcultures associate Zone-3 with swirling nebulae cosmic dust clouds and alien pattern The intensity of vortical involvement with Zone-6 problematizes distinct characterization Centauri subdecadence maps Zone-3 onto the active side of the Fourth or Crown Pylon on the Atlantean Cross As the light aspect of Fortune far future it corresponds to extrinsic fatality unexpected messages and xenosignal Stillwell links Zone-3 to the Munumese quasiphonic

Four The Numeral 4 There are two basic versions of the figure one open and the other closed into a triangle The former design is echoed in the symbol for the planet Jupiter It is the latter instantiated here that figurally relates four to the sign for delta fourth letter of the Greek alphabet and accounts for the fact that in certain hacker numerolects it is substituted for the upper-case letter A The figure 4 designates the number four the second even number and first nonprime or complex natural number with prime factors of 2 x 2 The fourth prime 7 The triangular summation or digital cumulation of four equals ten numerologically identified with a superior power of unity classically conceived as the Pythagorean Tetrakys The pre-eminences of four as first non-prime and first square are formally or germinally anticipated by unity Four digitally cumulates to ten see above Numeric Keypad direction West Due to the internal redundancy of its dual symmetry 2 x 2 2 + 2 4 four is commonly conceived as the model outcome of calculation as indicated by the phrase putting two and two together The dominant associations of the number four are balance and stability exemplified by the four-square or solidary structure of four walls wheels or quadrupedal support as well as by the four-four beats of rigidly metric dance-music It is this sense of quadrature that predominates in the four elements earth air water fire the four cardinal directions north south east and west and the four DNA bases adenine cytosine guanine and thymine A similar fourfold typology is expressed by the four suits of the playing-card pack clubs diamonds hearts spades Four is also associated with temporal stability or cyclic regeneration as evidenced by the four seasons Spring Summer Autumn Winter four classical ages those of gold silver bronze and lead and in Hindu culture far more intricately by the four Yugas those of Krita Treta Dvapara and Kali The system of the Yugas is a fully elaborated quadro-decimal system highly suggestive in relation to the Tetrakys Within the Judaeo-Christian tradition the number four is invested with extraordinary significance from the four letters of the Tetragrammaton through the four gospels to the four great Zoas and four horsemen of apocalypse The biblical time of both old and new testaments places particular importance on the period of forty days eg the duration of the flood and of Jesus temptation in the desert This privileging of quadrate order as the ground-plan of the temple is also instantiated by the masonic square The number four is also of special importance to Buddhism as exemplified by the four noble truths of its basic doctrine and by the typical quadrate design of the mandala On the flip-side the number four is connected with excess the fourth dimension anomaly the four-leafed clover and vulgarity four-letter words The Fourth Planet Mars Mars or Sol-4 has a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 228 000 000 km The Martian year is roughly twice as long as that of Earth and its day about 30 minutes longer Mars has two moons Phobos and Deimos The surface of Mars is swept by vast dust-storms that occasionally envelop the whole planet for months In popular legend Mars has long been envisaged as the home of intelligent alien life Recent examples include the canals discovered by Percival Lowell the fictions of HG Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Cydonia face based on images from the 1976 Viking missions Mars is widely seen as a plausible candidate for human colonization It has also become notorious for cursed space-missions In August 1996 scientists announced the discovery of Martian nanoworms in a ancient meteorite cat ALH84001 In Roman mythology Mars a latinization of the Greek Ares is the god of war and father of Romulus legendary founder of Rome Mars is commemorated by the month of March In Lemurian Planetwork Mars is astrozygonomously paired Jupiter System

rigidity has as its flip-side a tendency to cataclysmic instability In its initiatory aspect Zone-4 functions as the Fourth Door or Time-Delta familiar from variations of the Kurtz-mythos as the worst place in the world Muvian sorcery attributes this door to the amphidemon and imp of the first degree Krako 40 The Fourth Gate Gt-10 feeds Zone-4 forward to Zone-1 Its ancient proto-Atlantean name the Gate of Submergence hints at its interlocking associations with completion catastrophe subsidence and decadence The Channel corresponding to the Fourth Gate is one of three concluding in Zone-1 and the only pro-cyclic channel within the Torque Its course reinforces the 5-4 or Sink Current in its rush towards termination and augments the weight of destiny it was under the influence of this line that Cecil Curtis departed upon his fatal journey into the land of the Tak Nma Zone-4 is allotted the Sarkonian Mesh-Tag 0015 Lemurian subcultures associate Zone-4 with delta-phase or terminal deliria Kurtz-Curtis end-of-the-river disintegration into malarial nightmares geoconvulsions continental subsidence and red-out Centauri subdecadence maps Zone-4 onto the passive side of the Third or Left

Roman numeral V upper-case letter V despite appearing as a quasi-alphabetical numeral is actually a numerical figure of a far older type exhibiting a vestigial link to pre-symbolic tallying systems such as the five-bar gate see one The figure 5 designates the number five the third odd number with odditude of 2 and the third prime fifth prime 11 five is one of the two prime factors of the decimal module with two a fact that is usually attributed to the number of fingers on one hand It is on this basis that five serves as modulus or submodulus in many counting and currency systems five digitally cumulates to fifteen Numeric Keypad direction Centre The number five has particularly strong anthropomorphic associations due to its multiple connections with human biological organization These are not restricted to the five digits per limb so crucial to the social history of numeracy but extend also to structural dimensions as varied as the five senses sight hearing smell taste and touch and the five spinal-levels coccygeal sacral lumbar dorsal cervical These anthropomorphic resonances are disturbed however by instances of fundamentally pentagonal body-plans pre-eminently that of the star-fish which is intrinsic to the aberrancy of the Lovecraftean Old Ones In monotheistic traditions the number five is associated with doctrinal authority as evidenced in the Pentateuch or five books of Moses and in the five pillars of Islam the arkan or five ritual duties In occult circles the importance of the number five is even more emphatic as indicated by the five elements of Chinese alchemy and by the designs of the pentagram the pentazygon and the the Atlantean Cross with its five stations Secular relics of the authoritative sense of five can be found in the five-year plans of command economies in the geopolitical symbolism of The Pentagon and perhaps in the near-universal prestige invested in Intel's Pentium processor The fifth Planet Jupiter Jupiter or Sol-5 has a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 778 330 000 km The Jovian year is roughly 119 Earth years in length and its day about 99 hours long Jupiter is the innermost gas-giant and by far the largest planet in the Solar-system accounting on its own for more than two-thirds of total planetary mass It has an extremely powerful magnetic field its magnetosphere extends beyond the orbit of Saturn Jupiter has sixteen moons The four largest or Galilean moons are Callisto Europa Ganymede Io Galileo's observations of these bodies provided crucial evidence for the Copernican revolution The oceans of Europa have been frequently identified as potential habitations for alien life a neomyth shared by Arthur C Clarke who also populated Jupiter with his alien Monoliths The most distinctive feature on the Jovian surface is the Great Red Spot a vast self-sustaining storm The size position and orbital regularity of Jupiter has led to it being credited with a crucial role in protecting the inner solar-system from meteoritic and cometary bombardment Jupiter or Jove latinizing the Greek Zeus is the sovereign of the Gods As god of the sky and of storms he has been systematically cross-identified with the Abrahamic Jehovah In Lemurian Planetwork Jupiter is astrozygonomously paired with Mars Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt widely hypothesized to be the fragments from a destroyed intermediate planet System Notes Zone-5 is the sixth of the six Torque-region Zones of the Numogram and TractorZone of the 7-2 or Hold Current Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-4 This 5+4 Syzygy carried by the demon Katak draws the innermost curve of the Barker-spiral with Zone-5 itself marking its central and terminal node or inner-eye Zone-5 both initiates and envelops the fifth-Phase of Pandemonium including 32 impulse-entities Horovitz remarks specifically upon the qabbalistic resonance of these values In its initiatory aspect Zone-5 functions as the fifth or Hyperborean Door attributed by Muvian sorcery to the amphidemon and imp of the first degree Tokhatto 50 In the inner esoteric circles of the AOE this demon is reverenced as the Angel of the Decadence Pack and even identified with the Archangel Meteka associations reinforced by numerous qabbalistic peculiarities The fifth Gate Gt-15 connects Zone-5 to Zone-6 and its corresponding channel tracks the path of abductions into the Warp Zone-5 is allotted the Sarkonian Mesh-Tag 0031 Lemurian subcultures associate Zone-5 with Hyperborean or Wendigo mythology Zone-5 mirrors Zone-2 and shares in its Crypt-linked themes of missing time and alien abduction Centauri subdecadence maps Zone-5 onto the active side of the Third or Left Pylon on the Atlantean Cross As the light aspect of Apocalypse destructive influences it corresponds to decision judgement and war Stillwell links Zone-5 to the Munumese quasiphonic particle ktt the Horowitzean paravocal tic Stillwell's ethno-topography of the

lower-case letters b d and q plus upper and lower-case P of particular and distinct interest to figural grammarians who have suggested that the ur-form of both six and nine were continuously involutionary spirals The figure 6 designates the number six third even number and second non-prime with prime-factors 2 and 3 Six is the first perfect number equivalent to the sum of its factors 1 2 and 3 and revered as such by Pythagoras Six digitally cumulates to twenty-one Numeric Keypad direction East Despite its perfection six is perhaps the darkest of the elementary decimal numbers due to its association with chance the six faces of the die ill-omen indicated by the ambivalence of the word or prefix Hex and occult intuition the sixth sense The six lines of the I Ching hexagram designate the six stages of change discovered by archaic Taoism which are numerically equivalent to the cyclic-sequence of digitally reduced binary-powers with values 1 2 4 8 7 5 In the Christian world the number six is ominously coloured by its triplicate reiteration 666 or six hundred three-score and six the Number of the Beast of Revelation which has preoccupied Christian qabbalism throughout the greater part of the last two Millennia Six-hunded and sixty-six is the triangular cumulation of thirty-six itself the second power of six The division of modern bar-codes into blocks punctuated by three sixes has been taken by some as an uncanny fulfillment of the biblical prophecy Rev XIII17 that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name Since thirty-six is the digital cumulation of eight however it is to that number and not six that this entire complex should ultimately be referred The number sixty 60 decimal escalation of six has acquired prominence due to its extraordinary and influential importance to Sumero-Babylonian culture from whom the modern world has inherited the sexigesimal principle of division into minutes and seconds still current within both chronometry and geometry The Sixth Planet Saturn Saturn or Sol-6 has a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 1 429 400 000 km The Saturnian year is a little over 2947 earth-years in length and its day has a length of roughly 1018 hours on the surface which is half an hour less than that of its solid core The Saturnian ring-system is divided into seven major bands labelled D C B A F G E since Huygens and actually consists of more than 100 000 component rings Saturn has eighteen confirmed and named moons although the total might be as high as thirty-two The largest moon Titan is more massive than Mercury Saturn has a magnetic field Its magnetosphere is about one-third the size of Jupiter's It is the least dense of the planets with an average density lower than that of water A huge standing wave pattern around the northern polar region produces the appearance of a permanent hexagon The Roman god Saturn is identified with the Greek Cronos god of time and father of Jupiter Neptune and Pluto amongst the planetary deities Saturn is celebrated in the seven days of Saturnalia the Roman Winter-festival and in the name of Saturday In Lemurian Planetwork Saturn is astrozygonomously paired with Earth System Notes Zone-6 is the second of the two Warp-region Zones of the Numogram Its Warpcomplement and

seven 7 includes the only pure diagonal to be found amongst the numeral figures and depends upon this oblique line to differentiate it from the numeral 1 as also to break it's rotational bond with the upper-case letter L It is ideographically connected to the lightning-stroke and related by composition to the similarly associated letter Z The figure 7 designates the number seven the fourth odd number with odditude of one and the fourth prime seventh prime 17 Seven digitally cumulates to twenty-eight Numeric Keypad direction North-West The biblical importance of the number seven is established at the beginning of Genesis with the religious derivation of the seven-day week from the six days of creation +1 Jewish mysticism deepens this association between seven and sacred time with an account of seven discarded creations preceding the current one and cast into the abyss The number seven is also notably prominent in Revelation where it is referred to the seven ancient churches to the seven angels seven seals seven last plagues seven vials of wrath and to the seven heads of the great beast which perhaps refer in turn to the seven hills of Rome The heptamania of Revelation is the probable source of the structurally ambivalence of seven within popular Christianity where it is attributed both to the seven cardinal virtues and the seven deadly sins A crescendo of seven-obsession is found in the Theosophical writings of Madame Blavatsky who divides the cosmic process into seven phases each characterized by one of seven sequential root races Blavatsky draws from biblical sources but is more directly influenced through the teachings of her Ascended Tibetan Masters by the usage of the number seven in a variety of Eastern religions including the Hindu seven worlds seven divine mothers and seven Rishis or sages the seven Buddhas and the seven Shinto gods of good fortune Religious and mystical investments of the number seven are closely connected to the seven planets of classical astronomy and traditional astrology from which the phrase seventh heaven is derived In recent times the Seven Sisters or Pleiades have taken up an increasing proportion of this cosmic-numerical freight The triplicate reiteration of the number seven is used as the title for Alistair Crowley's book of numbers 777 a number corresponding to the gematria value of the law of Thelema according to Alphanumeric Qabbala The Seventh Planet Uranus Uranus or Sol-7 has a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 2 870 990 000 km The Uranian year is a little over 84 Earth-years in length Its day lasts for roughly seventeen and one quarter hours Uranus has five large moons plus at least ten smaller ones The two largest moons Oberon and Titania were discovered by Herschel in 1787 It also has a ring-system involving eleven known bands the five most prominent of these are designated by the Greek letters from Alpha to Epsilon The rotation of Uranus is abnormally tilted and is almost perpendicular to the ecliptic warping its magnetic field The bluish colour of Uranus is ascribed to absorption of red-light by atmospheric methane In Greek mythology Uranus was the god of the heavens incestuous son of Gaia and father of Cronos Saturn the other Titans the Cyclops the hundred-headed giants and others Led by Cronos the Titans killed and mutilated Uranus spawning the Furies from his blood and Aphrodite from his severed genitals In recent times Uranus has become the butt of infantile scatalogical humour In Lemurian Planetwork Uranus is astrozygonomously paired with Venus System Notes Zone-7 is the fifth of the six Torque-region Zones of the Numogram and TractorZone of the 8-1 or Surge Current Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-2 The 7+2 Syzygy is carried by the demon

in Indian culture to the realm of snake-demons Nagas and to the serpent of the deep Ahi In the West it is related to Ourobouros the serpent of eternity eating its own tail The figure 8 designates the number eight the fourth even number and the third non-prime with prime factors 2 x 2 x 2 Multiple evidences indicate that eight was an important modulus in the late prehistory of numeracy most remarkable in this respect is the strong connection between the words for nine and new in various languages including Latin Eight is the third power of two with factors 1 2 and 4 and constitutes a crucial grouping in digital electronics with eight bits equalling one byte with a power of combinatorial variation equal to two-hundred and fifty-six It is the same set of numerical features that support the octave of western music Eight digitally cumulates to thirty-six Numeric Keypad direction North The ophidian tendency in the figure eight is compunded by the deep association of the number with cephalopodian entities pre-eminently the octopus and by derivation with the entire range of tentacle-face beings such as the Oankali of Octavia Butler A further more tenuous connection might be made to the amphibian hybrids of Dr Octagon half shark-alligator half man Both numerically and figurally eight is associated with perfection in the sense of macrocosmic completion and return These are particularly notable in the East where obvious references include the Buddhist eightfold path and the eight immortals of Taoism The number eight particularly in its triplicate reiteration 888 is considered an especially auspicious number in Chinese culture According to the Dogon eight is the number of Nomo and as such the primary key to their cosmo-numerical system Eight is the digital source by cumulation to the second power of the number of the beast 666 see Six The Eighth Planet Neptune Neptune or Sol-8 is the outermost gas-giant with a mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 4 504 000 000 km Due to eccentricities in the orbit of Pluto it is periodically the outermost ninth planet see Pluto Zone-9 The Neptunian year is slightly under 1648 Earth-years in length Its day lasts for approximately sixteen hours Neptune has eight known moons of which Triton is by far the largest It also has at least five thin and dark rings Neptune shares various features with Uranus including an anomolously oriented magnetic field and a bluish hue due to absorption of red-light by atmospheric methane The prediction of Neptune's existence and its subsequent discovery in 1846 on the basis of perturbations in the orbit of Uranus was a crucial moment of consolidation for mathematical celestial mechanics In Roman mythology Neptune is the sea god identified with the Greek Poseidon In Lemurian Planetwork Neptune is astrozygonomously paired with Mercury System Notes Zone-8 is the fourth of the six Torque-region Zones of the Numogram Its Syzygetic-twin is Zone-1 The 8+1 Syzygy is carried by the demon Murmur known to Muvian sorcerors as the nethermost denizen of time Zone-8 both initiates and envelops the Eighth-Phase of Pandemonium including 256 impulse-entities This association with the digital byte eight bits cements its importance within cybergothic cults In its initiatory aspect as the Eighth Door Zone-8 is problematically identifiable with the Muvian amphidemon and imp of the first degree Minommo 80 This demon figures prominently in the dream sorcery of the Mu Nma The Eighth Gate Gt-36 connects Zone-8 to Zone-9 and the corresponding Channel is the sole path of escape from the Torque or Time-Circuit into the Plex Due to its digital cross-match with the 6+3 Syzygy occupying the Warp-region of the Numogram and carried by the Xenodemon Djynxx 63 the Eighth Gate seems to address what Stillwell has called the ultimate numogrammatic enigma that of the intercommunication between the Warp and Plex regions This linkage is crucially emphasized in the culture of Tzikvik shamanism and under the name Gate of Charon is taken-up into Late-Atlantean apocalypticism since its digital sum 36 itself cumulates to 666 and thus echoes the number of Seals to the Great Abyss long

Pluto The figure 9 designates the number nine the fifth odd number with odditude of three and the fourth non-prime with prime factors 3 x 3 Nines are produced by unit subtractions n 1 from pure decimal magnitudes a numerical practice most frequently encountered in a retail context eg 999 In order to produce arithmetical consistency in respect to 1-3 x 3 one is mathematically equated with point nine recurring 0999 This equation which provides a virtual infinite decimal-expansion for every number is indispensable for Cantorean diagonalization Nine digitally cumulates to forty-five Numeric Keypad direction North-East The number nine has a null value in digital reduction practically enabling all nines to be eliminated from any complex reduction involving at least one digit other than nine or zero The same formula 9 0 is also derivable from Barker twinning or Zygonovism long familiar to Dogon sorcery for which nine functions as the summative key Such zygonovism or nine-sum coupling divides the decimal numerals into five twins and underlies both Numogram syzygetics and the game of Subdecadence The number nine is the last numeral of the decimal system and its associations with death and fatality are primarily based on this purely numerical modular function of termination There are nine rivers of the underworld and the mortuary aspect of the cat is indicated by her nine lives Charles Manson's adoption of the Beatle's Revolution-9 or Revelation IX as an apocalyptic family anthem was fully in keeping with this aspect of the number Alternatively nine is acknowledged as the highest numeral and associated with celestial inspiration the nine muses and bliss Cloud-9 Nine solar planets are recognized by modern astronomy as also by the ancient Lemurian Planetwork The duplicate reiteration of nine is remarkable for it's theomystical resonances Islam 99 lists ninety-nine incomparable attributes of Allah The Anglossic value of YHVH 99 According to the cryptic Black Atlantean cargo-cult Hyper-C the number ninety-nine as dramatized by the Y2K panic designates the cyclic completion of time The Ninth Planet Pluto Pluto or Sol-9 has the most highly elliptical orbital trajectory of any planet in the Solar-system with a highly variable mean orbital distance from the sun of approx 5 913 520 000 km Due to the extreme eccentrity of its orbit Pluto periodically switches places with Neptune as eighth planet from the Sun The Plutonian year is approximately under 2477 Earth-years in length Pluto was not discovered until 1930 Its anomalous orbit which is both abnormally elliptical and also angled off the ecliptic has led many to the conclusion that it is not a normal planet at all Suggestions as to its nature include the hypothesis that it is a captured or adopted body perhaps from the Kuiper Belt of Trans-Neptunian objects or alternatively an escaped Neptunian moon Pluto has one known moon Charon discovered in 1978 and named after the ferryman who guides the dead across the river Styx Charon is the largest satellite relative to its parent planet in the Solar-system In Roman mythology Pluto is the god of the underworld identified with the Greek Hades The topographically twisted association of the innermost with the outermost technically described as Plutonic-looping is exemplified by the identification of the most distant planet with the inner core of the Earth The existence of Pluto was anticipated by HP Lovecraft who named the as-yet-unknown planet Yuggoth In Lemurian Planetwork Pluto is astrozygonomously paired with the Sun System Notes Zone-9 is the second of the two zones mutually composing the Plex-region of the Numogram and Tractor-Zone for the 9-0 or Plex current Its Plex-complement and Syzygetic-twin is Zone-0 This 9+0 Syzygy carried

connects Zone-9 to itself transducing the third involutionary channel see Zone-0 Zone-1 Nma sorcery refers to it as the Gate of Pandemonium a fact Stillwell attributes to the coincidence of its number 45 with that of the Nma demonomy The Tzikvik associate it with Tchukululok fabled City of the Worms and emphasize its numerical cross-match with the 5+4 Syzygy whose demonic carrier they call Kattku the Nma Katak The Xxignal track Utterminus is dedicated to the Ninth Gate linking it to K-goth synthanatonic fugues In contrast Polanski's film The Ninth Gate despite its title has only the most

familiar with the Western Magical Tradition it is likely that the Numogram will initially evoke the Qabbalistic Tree of Life Both are constructed as decimal diagrams involving webs of connectivity between ten basic zones mysteriously twisted into a cryptic ultra-cycle that links upper and lower regions Both treat names as numbers and numerize by digital reduction and cumulation Both include passages across abysmal waters and through infernal regions Both map zones onto spinal levels Despite these manifold interlinkages there are compelling reasons to consider the Tree of Life a scrambled variant of the Numogram rather than a parallel system During its long passage through Atlantean and post-Atlantean hermetic traditions the systematic distortions of the Numogram introduced to confuse the uninitiated gradually hardened into erroneous doctrines and a dogmatic image of the Tree Most evidently a vulgar distribution of the numbers in their exoteric counting-order was substituted redundantly for the now esoteric numogrammatical distribution which proceeds in accordance with immanent criteria the web emerging qabbalisitically from the zone-numbers themselves More devastatingly the orginal consistency of numeracy and language seems to have been fractured at an early stage introducing a division between the number of the Sephiroth 10 and that of the Hebrew alphabet 22 The result was a break between the nodes of the tree and the interconnecting paths ruining all prospect of decipherment The Sephiroth segmented over-aganist their connections become static and structural whilst the paths lose any rigorous principle of allocation A strictly analogous outcome is evident in the segmentation of the Tarot into Major and Minor Arcana Increasingly desperate arbitrary and mystifying attempts to re-unite the numbers and their linkages seems to have bedevilled all succeeding occult traditions Two Numogram and I Ching There is considerable evidence both immanent and historical that the Chinese I Ching and the Nma numogram share a hypercultural matrix Both are associated with intricate zygonomies or double-numbering systems and process abstract problematics involving subdivisions of decimal arrays as suggested by the Ten Wings of traditional I Ching commentary Digital reduction of binary powers stabilizes in a six-step cycle with the values 1 2 4 8 7 5 These steps correspond to the lines of the hexagram and to the time-circuit zones of the Numogram producing a binodecimal 6-Cycle which is also generated in reverse by quintuplicative numbering In both cases a supplementary rule of pairing is followed according to a zygonovic criterion 9-twinning of reduced values 81 72 54 mapping the hexagram line pairs The numogram time-circuit or I Ching hexagam implictly associates zero with the set of excluded triadic values It is intriguing in this respect that numerous indications point to an early struggle between triadic and binary numbering practices in ancient Chinese culture suggesting that the binary domination of decimal numeracy systematically produces a triadic residue consistent with nullity The hexagram itself exhibits obvious tension in this respect since it reinserts a triadic hyperfactor into the reduced binodigital set compounded by its summation to twenty-seven or the third power of three An ancient binotriadic parallel to the I Ching called the T'ai Hsuan Ching or Book of the Great Dark consisted of eighty-one tetragrams reversing the relation of foregrounded and implicit numerical values The division of Lao Tse's Tao Te Ching into eighty-one sections suggests that this numerical conflict was an animating factor in the early history of Taoism Three Ethnography of the Nma Nma culture cannot be decoded without the key provided by the Lemurian TimeMaze The influence of a hypertriadic criterion of time is evident in the relics of Nma kinship organization calendrics and associated rituals Prior to the calamity of 1883 the Nma consisted of true tribes tripartite macrosocial divisions They were distributed in a basic tridentity interlocking large-scale groupings into Tak- Mu and Dib-Nma supported by a triangular patrilocal marriage-cycle Each marriage identified a woman with a numogram current or time-passage Tak-Nma women marrying into the Mu-Nma Mu-Nma ditto Dib-Nma Dib-Nma ditto TakNma The common calendar of all three tribes was based upon a zygotriadic system using 6 digits to divide a double-year period of 729 days into fractional powers of three The Mu-Nma still employ such a calendar today The current Mu-Nma calendar is adjusted by regular intercalations of three additional days every second cycle or four years The earlier practice of intercalations is not easily recoverable In the rituals of the Nma the time-circuit is concretized as a hydro-cycle a division and recombination of the waters The three stages of this recurrent transmutation are 1 the undivided waters oceanic 2 cloud-building evaporation and 3 down-pour precipitation river-flow These are associated with the great seabeast Mur Mur the lurker of steaming swamps Oddubb and that which hunts amongst the raging storms Katak The cycle is closed by a return to the abysmal waters intrinsically linking the order of time and its recurrence to an ultimate cataclysm prior to any opposition of cyclic and apocalyptic time It is in this context that the transcultural deluge-mythos can be restored to its aboriginal sense which also corresponds to the Hindu Trimurti with its three stages of creation preservation and destruction Numogrammatic Time-Mapping In Peter Vysparov's construction of the Cthulhu Club System the central region of the Numogram is labelled the Time-Circuit or the Domain of Chronos Despite misgivings about mythopoetic arguments it is worth briefly rehearsing aspects of Vysparov's discussion According to the Greek myth Chronos was the son of Uranus and Gaia last of the Titans and God of Time married to the Goddess Rhea Revolting against the tyranny of Uranus Gaia provided Chronos with a sickle with which he hacked the sexual organs from his father killing him and producing various fall-out entities Erinyes Giants and Meliae Chronos also fell under the prophecy that he would suffer an analagous fate at the hands of his offspring He thus devoured the first five Hestia Hera Demeter Poseidon and Hades order to me uncertain Hestia first daughter but Zeus escaped and poisoned him The five consumed children were regurgitated as their father died Vysparov seems to have been convinced that these six offspring of Chronos three of each sex could be rigorously allotted zonal houses on the Numogram TimeCircuit consistent with the Pythagorean gendering of numbers If he ultimately succeeded in establishing these co-ordinations his results do not seem to have reached us Vysparov also emphasized that this founding myth is one of time disintegration not time persistence The Domain of Chronos is a burial complex ordering the world through the death of integral time Whether beginning from Kant's identification of time with the content of arithmetic or Einstein's definition of time as a fourth dimension attempts to model time seem to necessarily call upon the number line The most elementary and notationally efficient chronometric and calendric systems count time by addition of unit periods from caesium atom half-lives through clock ticks to day counting and annual date-changing Whatever the scale the procedure remains the same the apparently basic arithmetical operation of additive succession +1 +1 +1 Of course mathematicians have known for well over two millennia that the number line in no way compels such an assumption Step-by-step additive progression by units is merely one arithmetically arbitrary mode of numerical accumulation Nevertheless it can at least be argued that this pattern of counting presents the overwhelmingly prevalent articulation of chronological common sense Echidna Stillwell refers to Vysparov's Time Circuit as the Hex She demonstrates the arithmetical consistency between this region of the Numogram and the Chinese Classic of Change or I Ching This intermapping is locked into place by two basic bino-decimal echoes 1 The six-step cycle of digitally-reduced binary magnitudes repeating the series 2 4 8 7 5 1 2 The 9-twinning of these repeating stages To quote Richard Wilhelm's commentary The following lines provided they differ in kind correspond the first and the fourth the second and the fifth the third and the top sixth line Stillwell cites the Nma version of an almost universally familiar story A poor mathematician from the great landmass came to the court with a game he had invented now called chess and the king was so enthralled by this diversion he asked the visitor whether there was anything he could offer as a token of appreciation The cunning mathematician replied Your majesty perhaps if you were to place a grain of rice on the first square two on the second and continuing thus doubling the number on each successive square until reaching the final 64th one it would at least spare me from the danger of starvation on my return journey Shocked by the modesty of this request the king readily agreed It was in this way the kingdom passed for the first time into the hands of strangers This tale attributed variously to Indian Chinese and Persian sources with minor variations in each case is now to be found mostly in schoolrooms where it is used as an aid in the teaching of binary exponentiation The topics it raises whether concerning mathematics games and power number and trickery numerical isomorphy between the chess board and the I Ching or other matters exceed the scope of this discussion Two points will suffice for now 1 The utter obscurity attending the origins of this tale provides highly suggestive support for Stillwell's ethnomic hypothesis with its argument that numerical potentiality is capable of generating spontaneous unlocalizable cultural syndromes 2 Binary exponentiation has a mythic dimension now largely supplanted in modern societies by Moore's Law of techonomic development A privileging of binary exponentiation rather than unit addition is entirely consistent with the prominence of the number line as a model of time The basic time unit however is now conceived as the doubling period This approach integrates an intriguing diversity of problematics 1 The I Ching where time progresses through doubling and bino-decimal cyclicity There is nothing exclusively modern about the extravagant power of time as an exponentially accumulative trend modernity lies rather in the evasion of disaccumulation crisis which in the time of the I Ching is described as an inevitability of periodic catastrophe 2 The Numogram Hex rigorously echoing the I Ching although with certain supplementary complexities exceeding the scope of this discussion The Numogram also positions the sphere of duplicative time within a greater and for now obscure time terrain 3 Qabbalistic tradition within which binary exponentiation has always provided the key to certain crucial combinatorial calculations Combinatorics qabbala and binary exponentiation share a common procedural reservoir 4 Transfinite arithmetic as consolidated by Cantor whose Continuum Hypothesis proposes that binary exponentiation to Aleph0 Aleph1 the real number line But this could go on forever AQ notes CHRONO 127 enough said CHRONOLOGY 222 a little theatrical perhaps CHRONOS 155 31 x 5 The pentanomic order is the strict complement of binary within the decimalized Oecumenon more on this elsewhere Qabbala Unshelled This provocative in fact insolently aggressive and sarcastic short text on the numogrammatic incoherence of the Hebrew Tree of Life was written by Frater V widely assumed to be P Vyparov and appeared as a letter in the short-lived journal Occultism Today on 6th September 1956 The Tree of Life is Essentially Qliphothic Professor Echidna Stillwell's literally path-breaking researches have opened the way to a rigorous Lemurian apprehension of the Hebrew Tree of Life as a degenerated hyperstitional structure Her numogrammatic perspective decisively reveals that there are no immanent principles supporting the arrangement of the Tree but only a dead tradition of acceptation authority without demonstration order without coherence or consequence We only need to ask Why does Kether the first Sephira occupy the crown of the Tree unless by merit of a banal ordinal mechanism no more than an instinctive reflex binding primacy to supremacy and unity Why does the zig-zag path of divine manifestation continue from Chokmah 2 to Binah 3 and then onwards in tedious ordinal conformity to the end of the series Is the mere order of the decimal numerals already a map of creation If so why the contrivance of a two-dimensional arrangement at all Why not simply say the great hermetic truth of the scared qabalah is the capability to count to ten and call it God's work And then why is Malkuth 10 entitled to sephirotic standing at all unless as a proto-decimal atavism attesting to an inability even to count to ten with understanding whose numerical incoherence is available for subsequent exploitation as a miraculous symbol of cyclic re-unification an unwitting tautology gaudily clothed in the pretence of cosmic significance As to the patent absurdity of Da'ath 11 a Sephira which would be simply laughable if not encrusted by bejewelled extravagances of magickal solemnity at this point even elementary arithmetical competence has been sacrificed without reserve to the mysteries of inscrutable tradition Imagining momentarily it were possible to sympathize with the servile consciousness of a magickal adept prostrating himself before this concoction of sub-numerical nonsense combining the calculative capabilites of a 13th century European peasant with the credulous enthusiasm of a Masonic zealot how are the paths between the Sephirot to be understood Of course there are 22 paths for the overwhelmingly persuasive reason that there are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet Let us also leave aside the fact that 22 is a number without any compelling numerical interest except as a tautological reverberation of tradition being the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and of course a doubling of Da'ath and merely ask what principle organizes their distribution Except of course that there is no such principle but only tradition blind authority and concretely a slithering downwards vaguely echoing that so gloriously exhibited by the Sephirot themselves Even that exultant obscurantist of occultic traditionalism Aleister Crowley is driven to admit With regard to the numbers 11 to 32 of the Key-Scale the Hebrew letters they are not numbers at all in our sense of the word They have been arbitrarily assigned to the 22 paths by the compiler of the Sepher Yetzirah There is not even any kind of harmony as if arbitrariness was any kind of stranger in this domain What a masterpiece of chaotic improvisation we are presented with regions paths letters and numbers jumbled together discordantly without anywhere betraying a hint of consistent articulation procedural regularity or objective plausibility One might as easily shuﬄe all these elements together on a whisky-soaked bar-table entirely without systemic motivation or lucid intelligence and then call the result a qabalistic revelation At least in this case some accidental order might arise to subvert the transcendent idiocy of the whole The Tree of Life is to rigorous occultism what Ptolemaic astrology is to modern astronomy a baroque relic of historical interest in the hands of scholars but an indefensible embarrassment when embraced by believers Let all those who have serious work to do be done with it lest the science of the Outer Spheres become universally derided as a joke Lurgo Mesh-00 Net-Span 10 The Call and its Numbers The Lemur of the 10 rift is called Gl'eiaoung in the Old Muvian Tongue Her name in modern Munumese is Lurgo which Stillwell translates into English as The Initiator The name Lurgo is apparently based on a reversal of the Munumese quasiphonic particle gl Horowitz phonologically identifies this collapsed gargle or glottal spasm with the fusion of a gutteral and a liquid He physiologically situates it in the sublaryngeal region and associates it with lost gilled-gulping phylogenetic stages of human ancestry Horowitz glimpsed something in the Lurgo's gl subphoneme that he saw as essential to the glottopolitics of English as a global language In the course of further investigating this particle he was drawn into what he referred to as a labyrinth of glitter-glyphs where sense is scattered in visual confusion and began to speak of glamours and glosses ultimately cascading down into the gulf-glued glug-logic of the glimmer ghouls although precisely what he meant by this remains obscure Lurgo as the first of the Lemurs is responsible for initiations door-openings thresholds guides and familiars The Tzikvik call her Oogvhu the Immortal Worm of primordial communication In Haitian Voodoo her role is taken by Legba the first and last of the Loa to be invoked in any ritual Legba's Lurgo-related characteristics are shared by Madame Centauri's Celestial messenger Logobubb Lurgo's net-span 10 links her to elementary principles of logical and arithmetical discrimination binary code the origin of number being and nonbeing During her study of the I Ching Stillwell became persuaded that due to her elementary net-span Lurgo was related with special intensity to the Taoist polarity of Yang and Yin light and shadow even suggesting that the I Ching's code of unbroken and broken lines was the relic of a primordial language first enunciated by Lurgo In Black Atlantean traditions the primal alternation described by Lurgo's net-span expresses the distance between divine unity and the void God and Chaos an abysmal gulf crossed in every Decadence ritual opened and closed by Lurgo Legba Logobubb Lurgo's net-span 10 clicks the 4th Gate Gt-10 the passage from Zone-4 to Zone-1 The working of the 4th Gate is numerically described by the Pythagorean Tetraktys 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 10 1 Pythagoras evidently derived this triangular-decimal reversion to unity and decimal disintegration of unity from archaic and ultimately Lemurian sources Among Black Atlanteans transit through Gt-10 offers a microcosmic recapitulation of the macrocosmic-numogrammatic route from Zone-1 to Zone-0 These relations echo the microcosmic-ceremonial subsidence of Atlantis as the sign of the Cosmic Fall or Great Decadence As the only Lemur of the 1st Phase Lurgo is called the first Door and also the Door of Doors Among the remnants of the Nma she is known as the Queen of Unlockings and her sign is inscribed at the entrance of their temples and above the shops of locksmiths Lurgo's mesh number 00 clicks the 0th Gate Gt-00 linking her to the most occulted region of numogrammatic cartography Lurgo's Sarkon-Tag is 0002 Quantities and Traits Lurgo has a pitch of Ana-1 slight positive imbalance Lurgo has no imps a fact which can be attributed equally to her primordiality or ultimateness As Peter Vysparov remarked Lurgo arrives first and she arrives alone In Vysparov's Pandemonium Matrix Lurgo is entitled the Plexing Amphidemon of Openings Rites of Lurgo The way of Lurgo has one path or route This follows her major rite 1890 In The Book of Paths the Rite of Lurgo is described as follows 1 Original Subtraction Ultimate descent through the Depths The path favours repeated patience linked by subtlety Superior subtlety opens the three hidden roads Compliance prevails Three tests on the way Immersive nightmares undergo an ominous transition Difficulties annihilated in the end Lurgo's rite descends out of time following the numogrammatic plunge line passing through the 8th gate Gt-36 which crosses from the lair of Murrumur into that of Uttunul Among the neolemurian tantric schools this rite maps yogic practices of Spinal descent into the nest of Kundalini the Thothtodlana of the Indus Stillwell Lurgo's Rite is evoked in a mirrored guise by the contemporary myth of the Kurtzline travelling up-river into the Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now In the dream sorcery of the Munumese Nago the Rite of Lurgo traverses the full passage from consciousness 1 to deep sleep 0 and thus charts a line of oblivion which begins in time but does not travel through it Horowitz is among those scholars of esoteric Judaism who have become fascinated by parallels between the Rite of Lurgo and the golem myth In an appendix to his translation of The Book of Paths he links the Original Subtraction to the removal of the initial aleph from the word emet written on the golem's head an operation required if one is to kill a golem This connection enabled him to exhume an esoteric mystical content to the myth in which the death of the golem symbolizes the opening of a path into the abyss The Lair of Lurgo In the Lemurian Planetworks Lurgo's domain 10 is situated between the orbits of Mercury and the Sun fittingly the Roman Mercury Greek Hermes is entitled the messenger of the gods and associated with traffick in all its forms including communication and trade Lurgo nests Minommo 80 Murrumur 81 Uttunul 90 Tutagool 91 and Ummnu 98 By nesting Ummnu final Lemur of the Pandemonium Matrix within herself Lurgo establishes the basis for the Munumese saying the end lies within the beginning The Lurgo Card 7C In the Centauri Decadence Pack Lurgo is allocated to the 7 of Clubs When mapped onto the Atlantean cross in accordance with Mme Centauri's system Lurgo corresponds to a plummeting line from the 1st Pylon memories and dreams to the 5th Pylon deep past Among her oracular implications within Decadence divination are falling in the theocosmic sense descent into hell journey to the underworld and pursuit of the Nether-Axis to its ultimate conclusion The Tale of How We Lost Our Tails There was a time when Orang Utan had a tail and so did each of us That was before Orang Utan made a big mistake and tried to cheat the demon Lurgo It is said that Lurgo dwells between Murrumur and Uttunul somewhere beneath the bottom of the sea but above the twins in the furnace No one knows how Orang Utan found her Maybe it was easier to swim down with a tail In any case everyone agrees about the deal they made down there which was to swap the stories of the upper and lower worlds Orang Utan was to collect all that could be told about Oddubb and about Katak and in exchange Lurgo would open the gate to the underworld If things had gone this way we would still have our tails It was probably Katak who due to her impatience gave Orang Utan bad advice and suggested that by climbing down her tail it would be possible to descend into Uttunul without Lurgo's help Ever since that time Orang Utan has been too ashamed to admit anything about it but it must have been something like that because certainly now Orang Utan has no tail and neither do any of us Katak Mesh-14 Net-Span 54 The Call and its Numbers The Lemur of the 54 rift is called Ktt'skr in the Ur Nma Tongue Her name in modern Munumese is Katak which Stillwell translates into English as The Desolator In the name Katak Horowitz finds the phonic molecule kt'k which he associates with ideas of falling or sinking This connection leads him to postulate an archaic numogrammatic source for the Greek prefix of descent Kata as in catastrophe cataclysm catatonic catabolism catadromic In a marginal comment on Geotraumatics DC Barker relates the name Katak both to the K-T missile which terminated the age of giant saurians and also to Krakatoa which decimated the Dib-Nma The Tzikvik identify her with the Kattku or madness of the great worm In the book of children's fables compiled from Nma sources by Echidna Stillwell's sister Medusa she is called Takka Katak's net-span 54 bridges the smallest interval and places her in the centre of the Barker Spiral She is described variously as tightly bound coiled or knotted wound up or compacted The Cthulhu Club write of a Katak effect when the smallest difference 54 has the greatest impact Positioned on the 5th Brink as ultimate Lemur of the 5th Phase Katak is the only Syzygetic Lemur to be poised at the edge of her domain linking her to imbalance thresholds and phase-changes Katak's net-span 54 ciphers the Ultimate Gate or Gate of Pandemonium Gt-45 which begins and ends in Zone-9 and echoes the completed Matrix of the Lemurs This suggests an all-encompassing reach to the powers of Katak which in combination with Katak's Global Rite comprises what the Tzikvik call the Fatal Secret of the Kattku Katak's mesh number 14 ciphers the 7th Lemur Sukagool 41 who haunts the Gate of Submergence Gt-10 This further consolidates Katak's connections with collapse and inundation The resonance between the Katakite Sink Current and the Sunken Track attests in certain respects to monotheistic monopolistic or totalitarian ambition and reduction to unity but also to a return to simplicity search for origins or slippage into indifferentiation Katak's Sarkon-Tag is 0047 Quantities and Traits As a Syzygetic Lemur Katak has null pitch She is thus characterized by perfect poise Despite her manifold associations

imps which aligns her with decimal numeracy while also further reinforcing her decimally-mediated relation to unity Katak feeds the Sink Current flowing from the Falling Drift to Zone-1 In Vysparov's Pandemonium Matrix Katak is entitled the Syzygetic Chronodemon of Cataclysmic Convergence Rites of Katak The way of Katak has two paths or routes These follow her syzygetic crossing 5--4 and her singular minor rite 418725 In The Book of Paths Katak's Syzygetic Rite is described as follows 30 Coiled Fervour Endless waiting in the Falling Drift The path favours patient activity Superior subtlety leads nowhere Poised entanglement Twinned tests make the way Between burning excitment and arid tension Katak is alone among the Syzygetic Lemurs in having a nonsyzygetic rite The uniqueness of this rite is compounded by the fact it encircles the entire Hex or time-circuit traversing complete sequence of past and future lives and seizing the whole of time and fate On the basis of this rite Katak is portrayed chasing her own tail and in its ophidian manifestation as the barking snake coiled back into itself as an Ur-Oroborus the Thothtodlana of the Tzikvik In The Book of Paths Katak's Global Rite is described as follows 31 Eternal Revolution Advance prolonged by waiting brings fractured completion The path first favours subtlety then repeated patience and activity Superior

Lair of Katak In the Lemurian Planetworks Katak's domain 54 is situated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter classically identified with war and sovereignty Astronomically this band coincides with the asteroid belt considered by some to be the pulverized remnants of a destroyed planet The Katak Card In the full Decadence pack Katak as a Syzygy is only included as one of the five eliminated jokers On the Atlantean Cross she corresponds to the Third Pylon named Apocalypse decamantically associated with destructive influences Tales Tzikvik traditional When the world was born Thothtodlana entered into the secret of the Kattku and confusing herself with the universe circled the whole of time That was when she swam through living flesh her hunger unlimited and furious She seemed doomed to devour herself forever The dead knew no rest and the earth shuddered It was then that Ooqvu the worm-witch arrived amongst us It was Ooqvu that found the pattern in the folds of Thothtodlana's skin and followed it back to Tchukululok It was Ooqvu that called to Thothtodlana from deep in Tchukululok and released her from the Kattku That is why we still carry the marks of Ooqvu on our skin

possession of the Ccru in late January 2000 shortly after William Kaye's untimely death contain several mentions of The Book of Paths referring to it on one occasion as the definitive confirmation of Stillwell's basic insight Yet despite extensive investigation the Ccru's attempts to access this text were consistently frustrated All inquiry into the book was suspended due to a complete lack of productive leads In 2003 the Ccru undertook an intensive investigation into Kaye's cryptic references to documented interconnections between William Burroughs Peter Vysparov and Lemurian time travel During the course of this research the Ccru entered into correspondence with the Vysparov estate inquiring into the contents of the Vysparov Library where Kaye had spent many years working as an archivist and cataloguing director The notorious library of the Vysparov family is reputed to contain one of the world's greatest collections of occult works During the final stages of the research project the Ccru received a package from the estate containing a photocopied document which although untitled proved upon careful inspection to be nothing less than the complete text of The Book of Paths Appended to this document was a single page also photocopied of a handwritten letter from Chaim Horowitz to Peter Vysparov dated February 1949 It is this text which is reproduced here On the basis of Horowitz's letter it can be confidently identified as the so-called B Manuscript of The Book of Paths one of three type-copies of Horowitz's first English translation from the Tibetan As far as the Ccru is aware this is the first time that The Book of Paths has been made publicly available in any language The Letter Dear Peter Here at last is a complete translation of the Old Book Having entrusted this package to Echidna's safekeeping1 I am assuming it has reached you undisturbed The translation has taken me over a year Perhaps inevitably some difficult choices had to be made It goes without saying that I have placed the strictest priority on the preservation of systematic coherence There is no need to remind you that the special circumstances attending the discovery of this text necessitate the very greatest discretion I extracted a copy from the place with considerable trouble but of that let us converse on another occasion2 Although I only had a brief opportunity to discuss the work with Echidna she had many interesting points to make as always In particular she has been able to find some tantalizing traces of its history within Chinese sources dating back to the Warring States period when it was already considered profoundly archaic with more than one dark school even suggesting that it preceded the I Ching It seems that by the early Tang it was considered to have been erased from the earth one of the yaoshu or devilish books destroyed utterly in Chin Shi Huang Di's great burning Echidna herself thinks there are indications it was already serving as an oracle for the mysterious culture of the Shu Kingdom 5000 years ago She has stumbled upon persistent rumours that a series of 84 bronze tablets were inexplicably removed from the Shu excavation site by figures described variously as looters or senior officials We are both hopeful that Mme C will be able to cast light on the oracular dimension of the work in truth this has eluded us both so far despite the most strenuous efforts3 I am sure you will agree that these pages inelegantly produced though they may be will add inestimable riches to your family's peerless collection of esoteria Perhaps even more importantly we are both confident it will prove itself profoundly relevant to your work on the Pandemonium System'4 Your invitation was received with great enthusiasm if at all possible we shall meet in the fall5 Yours with heartfelt regards Chaim Notes 1 Horowitz met the esteemed Lemurologist Echidna Stillwell in Rangoon during the early spring of 1949 2 The Place clearly designates the source of the Mu Archives where Horowitz conducted research throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s William Kaye believed that it was located in a concealed sub-basement of the Potala Palace in Lhasa 3 Mme C almost certainly refers to Zelda Maria de Monterre better known as Madame Centauri During this period Madame Centauri was working as a celestial consultant or fortune teller in New York 4 As of now May 2004 Ccru has not been able to determine whether any such profound relevance was in fact discovered 5 There can be little doubt that the invitation concerned the inaugural meeting of the Cthulhu Club scheduled for the fall of 1949 The Book 1 Original Subtraction Ultimate descent through the Depths The path favours repeated patience linked by subtlety Superior subtlety

was Made Long ago when things were older than they are now there was nothing that was before Eventually Katak became so exhausted by everything being at once that she couldn't even chase her own tail and that made her furious She was so angry that without mentioning anything to Oddubb she asked Murrumur to help her bury time under the sea Murrumur thought about Katak's suggestion for so long that Katak became impatient and set off back to her lair Now she was even angrier because she knew this would happen She fumed and raged so that the earth split oozing lava and smoke but when she arrived back she found that somewhere on the way most of time had gone Maybe Oddubb had something to do with it but no one knows Katak didn't care and began to dance Murrumur is still thinking about Katak's suggestion even now It was Nummako that was the past from then on but she has always thought of herself as the oldest of all things and there are many who say that is true Most have forgotten all of this however because Nummako was so long ago The Tale of How the Sun was Torn It is said that there was a time when nothing was missing from the sun Katak was quite angry then but not so much as she is now This is because whenever anything needed to drink from the sun it would ask Katak for permission and every day she became more proud In truth Katak shares the sun with Oddubb and some say that when it dies each night it hides with Murrumur in the world of shades but Katak pretends that it is all hers and Oddubb who is very shy doesn't seem to mind In those days there was a Sun-King on earth who raised vast temples to Katak and every day Katak would visit the temples and be worshipped there whilst the sun blazed overhead complete One day however Katak found the temples charred and broken the Sun-King dead and the sun which still burnt above was spotted with loss Katak roamed around the whole of time to catch the thief but eventually returned finding nothing but scorch-marks from the stranger's flight These had become so confused with her own tracks that she gave up her hunt in a rage Spinning and howling she spat furiously It was Tchattuk who escaped with part of the sun and now hides on the outside I missed her and now it is too late The Tale of the Secret Plague In some time that was not this or not in the same way that this is it is said that a disease arrived on earth from between the stars that it was so cunning no one ever knew they were sick and that it was the first thing from Mummumix No one who knows about Mummumix doubts that this is her way of things and that is why she is called the mist-crawler but it seems that for a long time only Murrumur knew she had arrived at all and Murrumur never said anything about it Eventually both Katak and Oddubb each in their own way found out that things were different somehow because of the way they were working out although the change was very subtle It was then agreed that Mummumix must have arrived long ago but no one had any idea what to do about it It was not that Mummumix did not matter but the way that she mattered was a great mystery to everyone and so nothing was done about it Katak was very angry at first but soon turned back to other things Oddubb was troubled for a while but eventually adapted to the situation Murrumur was silent about it It seems that there must be an end to this story but who knows what it will be Few speak of Mummumix these days and those who do have little to say about her Appendix-1 Ccru Glossary Abomenon Postulated substrate of absolute horror the worst thing in

letter purportedly addressed to Andrew Davenport Co-creator and writer of the Teletubbies was recently forwarded to us in Shanghai for unknown reasons Considering it had some measure of hyperstitional significance we are reproducing it here PBS link Dear Sir I am troubling you with this letter both to elicit information and to express certain concerns Hopefully it will be evident that it is written with the very greatest respect from one long schooled in the arcane sciences to another Having carefully studied your popular children's television show Teletubbies for many years I am confident I have gained a basic mastery of its essential content Please forgive me if I suggest this understanding was acquired with greater ease than is altogether healthy or compatible with appropriate hermetic prudence on your part To be frank the teletubbies wear their occult pedigree on their furry jumpsuits their direct derivation from the five diplodemons of Sumatran time sorcery being starkly apparent to any but the most vegetative ignoramus Thus the obvious question arises what happened to the fifth Teletubby Please understand that I am not questioning the necessity of this excision It goes without saying that the supervisory authorities of which I trust no more need be said would have demanded it if an elementary instinct for self-preservation had not already done so Only a lunatic would fight for the right to spread Pentazygonic Lemurianism among the world's infants So my uttermost discretion can of course be assumed Nevertheless my question remains While theories and speculations on the topic of the missing fifth are abundant in the relevant literature where Noonoo the Baby Sun even the infant viewer have been proposed these can all in my humble opinion be dismissed as groundless The missing fifth must for obvious reasons of arcane science be of the same Suprageneric type as its four Similarchons with appropriate discriminative name height intonation colour-coding antenna-form and magical weapon At the risk of self-contradiction I must now append my warning to this request While frustrated by the inaccessibility of the information specified above I am also alarmed by the denuded hermeticism characterizing your show Although we initiates of the arcane circle have long-understood that the future of religion on this planet approximates far more closely to the Teletubbies than to any existing organized faith is it entirely wise to pronounce this truth so baldly to an ill-educated public Such things have been occulted for a reason I am sure you would agree Was it really necessary for example to so exactly portray the hideous ecstasies of the Tzog-Murtha ritual A glistening vortex activates and the beings moan Uh oh their eyes droop with bliss and they fall on their backs in technocosmic delirium After the big hug is no blasphemy to be hidden from the world's toddlers they clamber up a hill and stand in the loose spectral formation their antennae illuminated by the transmission and their belly monitors sparking with static from the Outer Spheres as they await the Chosen One It is rare indeed for even the most determined investigators into this abominable rite to have witnessed it unflinchingly portrayed in such comprehensive and graphic detail Even those entirely innocent of the Tzog-Murtha cults cannot but be struck by the sorcerous inclinations of the show with its incantations and manifestation of objects through songs More provocative still is the Baby Sun who mocks God the Father Logos and the universe of adult authority with its inarticulate burblings and chaotic mirth These incautious references are given a further ominous twist by the blatant Lemuro-Cybergothic dimension of the teletubby mechanoverse Those the Chinese insightfully translate as the Antenna-babies Tianxian Baobao are the fully cyborgian inhabitants of a futuristic underground bunker whose parents have been replaced by an semi-intelligent autonomous vacuuming unit called Noonoo combined with a complex subterrestrial acoustic apparatus Their highly-synthetic diet produced entirely by machines consists exclusively of tubby custard and tubby toast a reiterated affront to the very idea of organic nourishment finally allow me to draw your attention to a recent article by media commentator Rev Douglas Frushlee entitled The Tubby Minions of Satan In this piece intended to warn parents against the show he describes it as an unrelenting festival of bionic barbarism and refers explicitly to Indonesian demonism If Frushlee who in all charity is not the sharpest pencil in the box can be picking up so clearly on the occultism of the series you can be confident that more sophisticated and powerful minds are tuning in to it as well with consequences scarcely to be imagined Thank you sir for attention to these matters Yours faithfully P B Carruthers Table of Contents Foreword Tale of the End Part-1
