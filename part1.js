identity = "Ccru Writings 1997-2003 Time Spiral Press 2015 timespiralpressnet timespiralpressgmailcom Foreword This volume gathers together finished texts written under the Ccru name Excepting pieces that have been irrecoverably lost it is to the best of our understanding complete The material it compiles has been accessible in other places before primarily on the Ccru website but also in certain cases elsewhere This is the first time that it has been brought together in a book The Ccru website has flickered in and out of existence over the last decade or more without anybody in the old Ccru circle fully or even tentatively grasping how this facility has been sustained or accepting responsibility for its preservation It now appears to have disappeared permanently This terminal submergence of the principal Ccru archival deposit has prompted the present publication There is nobody positioned to accept attribution for the work of the Ccru nor has there ever been so this compilation has been guided by a principal of editorial modesty Whatever it is that occurred here during these years of the Numogram's initial ingression into recent human history triggering an outbreak of digial hyperstition is not considered a matter to be resolved in this volume even in part through retrospective commentary This book is sheer documentation It is not expected to clarify anything but much rather the reverse The order and grouping of materials is roughly topical No attempt has been made at consistent chronological reconstruction All editorial commentary and notes attached to these texts belong to the original Editorial intervention has been restricted to syntactical regularization with a bias towards logic over convention On occasion some signs have been added to mark breaks in passages originally separated only by spacing and the definite article has been added to some titles Otherwise stylistic infelicities factual errors conceptual absurdities and ethico-political monstrosities have been left undistubed Although original to the Ccru site the Ccru Glossary has been categorized as an appendix due to its extremely general application The second appendix on TV demonism belongs outside the time-frame and micro-sociology of this collection but was attached due to its obvious and extreme pertinence The Tale of the End There was a time when Murrumur asked Katak and Oddubb a question and although this was very long ago it was the last question she has ever been known to ask It was Ummnu the last of the demons who provoked this question since Murrumur felt her to be always nearby and yet never ceased to be confused by her so that eventually she asked How can the end be already in the middle of the beginning So this was Murrumur's final question and probably also her first but it was no use at all Neither Oddubb nor Katak has ever noticed Ummnu because she is half hidden in the depths of Murrumur and half hidden deeper still so Oddubb was puzzled and said nothing Katak however found Murrumur's question extremely irritating and replied scornfully What nonsense I have travelled around forever and there was never any suggestion of an end or of a beginning With those words she swirled off as if returning to her lair but secretly to patrol time again which was also the first time just to be sure After that Katak was more sure than ever that she was right or at least no less sure and that was very sure indeed Oddubb was so perplexed that she soon became muddled about what it was that had perplexed her and so forgot all about it and probably forgot even forgetting it So Murrumur was left alone with her confusion and maybe she will sort it out in the end but then again since it has already been so long maybe she never will Part-1 Id entity Exercises

Culture pamphlet series concept engineering upcoming books and CDs intercoil along a line of continuous variation Communique Two Message to Maxence Grunier 2001 1 What are pulp theory fiction hybrids In France the old old continent we don't have any kind of cultural studies and cyber-culture means nothing Can you explain your theories in newbie's words Many members of the Ccru had fled cultural studies disgusted by its authoritarian prejudices its love of ideology and pompous desire to represent the other or speak on behalf of the oppressed To us it never seemed that the real articulacy of the left academic elites was in any way superior to the modes of popular cultural expression which were either ignored or treated as raw material to be probed for a true ie ideological meaning by white middle-class intellectuals Ccru has tried to connect and cross-intensify with peripheral cultural processes dark-side digital audio cyberpunk Neolemurian sorcery numbo-jumbo Afro-futurism Indo-futurism Sino-futurism It seeks to think theorize and produce with rather than about or -even worse for them We think everything interesting happens on the periphery outside the standard modes of developed existence Ccru engages with peripheral cultures not because they are down-trodden or oppressed but because they include the most intense tendencies to social flatness swarming populating the future and contagious positive innovation hatching the decisive stimuli for the systematic mutation of global cybernetic culture Cyber-culture has come to be synonymous with Internet-studies Ccru has a more fundamentalist commitment to cybernetics whose abstract principles of feedback dynamics nonlinear causality and machinic involvement are linked to numerous issues concerning digital technology and telecommunications but in no way restricted to these Ccru has consistently endorsed Deleuze and Guattari's insistence that machines are irreducible to technology We consider cybernetics to be the practical science of excitement amplification inhibition of communication mutation and innovation A Ccru list of important influences would include Deleuze and Guattari's two Capitalism and Schizophrenia volumes with their virtual materialism assault upon the privilege of representation anti-evolutionism and implacable hostility to the State Fernand Braudel's rigorous differentiation and even opposition between capitalism and the market economy with pro-market anti-capitalism functioning as a guiding slogan William Gibson's Cyberspace Trilogy which spreads voodoo into the digital economy demonstrating with the Cyberspace Matrix how a fictional concept makes itself real Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis novels for their tentacled aliens gene-traffic and decoded sex Lynn Margulis bacterial microbiology for outlining the world of destratified life H P Lovecraft's gothic obsessions with time-anomaly sacred horror of teeming bubbling foaming multiplicities We are currently enthralled by the work of Jacques Vallee and its extraordinarily sophisticated path to hyperstition through the UFO-phenomenon Ccru is working on a cybergothic unnon-fiction to steal a term from Steve Beard which interconnects the history of computing and AI research with UFO-phenomena alien abduction false-memory and cover-ups secret societies and esoteric religion amongst other things Ccru is an ongoing experiment in collectivity collective production anonymity and masks dedicated to practically dismantling standard models of social existence by pursuing ethics in the spinozistic sense experimental production of collective bodies Ccru feeds its own researches back into its own microcultural production Its basic tool in this respect is pulp-theory fiction hybridity or Hyperstition see below 2 What were the goals of Virtual Futures Afro-Futures and Virotechnics These events sought to reinforce and energize the interrelations between elements of theoretical research and popular culture It was important to us that they were characterized by a minimum of academic stuffiness and that contemporary sonic culture techno and jungle were as thoroughly mixed into proceedings as possible Ccru particularly encouraged polymedia presentations involving spoken text audio and video or other visuals Our assumption throughout was that philosophy social theory could be exciting and that the deadening of all visceral response to intellectual exchange was a semi-deliberate strategy serving oppressive social interests The three Virtual Futures conferences were large international events and thus only diffusely focused Over the years guests included Manuel Delanda Pat Cadigan Stelarc Scanner and many others Afro-Futures was a smaller scale event in which members of the Ccru along with key ally Kodwo Eshun explored the interlinkages between peripheral theory rhythmic systems and Jungle Drum & Bass audio Virotechnics was organized outside the academy and was dedicated to the theme of cross-propagation between cultural viruses and digital technologies 3 What is the concept of the the Syzygy hyperstition matrix Syzygy was the title of a five week art show co-produced by Ccru and Orphan Drift The name means twinning or twin-system and this theme operated as a multilevelled guiding thread It was during the production of this event that Ccru made contact with the virtual Continentity of Lemuria which taught us many secrets that we have since attempted to formulate as Digital Hyperstition Digital hyperstition is already widespread hiding within popular numerical cultures calendars currency systems sorcerous numbo-jumbo etc It uses number-systems for transcultural communication and cosmic exploration exploiting their intrinsic tendency to explode centralized unified and logically overcoded master narratives and reality models to generate sorcerous coincidences and to draw cosmic maps The Lemurian biomechanical hyperculture propagates itself through decimal notation whose latent interconnections are demonstrated in the Numogram see website an occult diagram of time and practical guide to the ethics of unbelief An initial attempt to clarify this topic has been made in the most recent issue of our journal Abstract Culture According to the tenets of Hyperstition there is no difference in principle between a universe a religion and a hoax All involve an engineering of manifestation or practical fiction that is ultimately unworthy of belief Nothing is true because everything is under production Because the future is a fiction it has a more intense reality than either the present or the past Ccru uses and is used by hyperstition to colonize the future traffic with the virtual and continually re-invent itself Review of Ccru's Digital Hyperstition Iris Carver and Linda Trent Digital Hyperstition is where the countdown runs out cross-hatching into horrors anticipated since before the beginning Ciphering a positive unbelief that both crazes-off into the latest thing and re-animates contacts older than anything imagined it skin-crawls out of cosmic gulfs where even the Old Ones remain unborn and arrives as Year Zero Teotwawki crash of Science fiction Ccru's recent volume on this theme is a rigorously unbelievable exercize in hyperpunk pulp-occultism and dark-side cyber-jargon splicing chunks of an impending calculus into fake memories of hell The evident cybergoth contamination throughout suggests it has been spawned in Crypt-connected hyperlink-labyrinths beneath and between the net a positive nonplace lurking beyond the threshold where the remnants of Earth's damned homonids whose gods are lying monsters shortsout into an anthrobotic mix-mash of burnt silicon and terminal screams This is a tool-kit for dabbling in the dark The issue here is Cyber-hype but now that the human race is virtually dead it's time for a preliminary excursus on the true history of the CCRU or for something vaguely like it Obviously it's a horror story At least twice in outer-time their numbers were immeasurable and their name was legion masked as an acronymic Underneath lies Ccru Cuh-Cru Crypt-denizen the many within itself that which spreads through the end-time dripping fake ID-tags like phosphorescent slime It makes a peopling machine on the hyperplane conjurations of identity hypersonas Consider the names on the contents page Melanie Newton Steve Goodman Ron Eglash We doubt it Even Dan Barker discovered that his existence was a fiction and Echidna Stillwell is more an ethnographic legend than a social fact In any case fact means invention and person means mask at least if Latin etymology is to be believed or meaning still matters In truth even Cecil Curtis was already branded by Ccru infection and his social disappearance was an emergence of another kind a vector Through him through his name the Nma get out of their own tribal codings or into the Oecumenon and compared to that what the history books tell of him counts for nothing If for us the Nma the death of the Nma designates also the death of anthropology it is by indicating that all primitive peoples are fictions or masks and that they ritualize this fact for themselves in advance of any anthropological metafiction The primitive comes last at the end which is Cyber-hype techonomics The socalled new-economy indexed by the nova-bubble mania of the American stockmarket is no different in its diagrammatic abstraction to the hyperstitious practices of the Plateau of Leng relics of lost Lemuria from which the Bon sorcerors of ancient Tibet assembled their dread cult Alan Greenspan calls it irrational exuberance amidst a panic hunt for crash-indicators Lemurian Necronomicon calls it Shadow-Feeder of the Chaotic Gulfs the Fatal Mother of Hyperstitions she of innumerable numbering names who shreds all that stands Whatever or however it is called Cyber-hype libidinally invests its own semiotic propagating fictional quantities tagging artificial agencies and making itself up as it goes along whilst dissolving production into cultural synthesis As it gets cheaper it gets harder to stop running-away off itself and into abstraction-catastrophe a self-assembling terrestrial destiny softening-up social reality for flat take-over by the Cyber-hype entity Hyper-seizure When hyper-cybernetics kicks-in the cyber- prefix means nothing anymore It culturally disorganizes itself into diagrammatic splinters and libidinal triggers brands jargons virus currency-tokens and traffic-signals fragments of marketing strategy gone feral cyberpunk fictional brands or improper names markers of meaningless involvement the pass-words of machinic delirium As for Cyber-hype ethnography American gothic is the only kind left a haunted Indian burial ground where sinister shreds of ancient shadow are autoformatted for the irrationally exuberant post-Puritan pulping machine amidst the brandingiron hiss of liquified flesh The ten most valuable global brands are all American which doesn't mean anything since America itself functions as a deterritorialized hype-sign or hyper-brand a planetary icon for libidinized meaninglessness God loses it entirely by blessing America coca-collapse a graffiti-tagged advertisements for globalization which is the end of the world

crash at the end of the second millennium Ccru is a meaningless brand-name but brands are demonic tuning into Cyber-hype dynamics numerizing culture and innovating methods of propagation Various things latch onto them in order to spread These latchings are sorceries involvements participations spirals of contamination and the darkest sorceries are calculations decimal deliria like Y2K except that nothing is like Y2K Y2K whose name is a dating number is no contradiction because it has nothing to say It is an outnumbering in itself pre-emptive commemoration and commencement of zero

subcodes call demons which are brands jargons and triggers positively instantiating the meaninglessness of their own designations infecting cultural systems with unbelief and counterposing sorcerous

she whose issue is Cyber-hype and is thus announced everywhere Who's Pulling Your Strings The following transcript was first brought to our attention in early December 2002 by a bemused colleague who came across it while trawling through the web for conspiracy-related material The site later disappeared without trace despite our persistent attempts to relocate it No doubt Ms Morrison will attribute this too to the Ccru take-over of cyberspace Though Morrison's allegation is clearly preposterous and the bulk of the content mystifies us entirely it indicates some limited albeit highly confused knowledge of recent Ccru cultural production No member of the Ccru has any recall whatsoever of encountering Ms Justine Morrison at any time We are not convinced that she even exists Our perplexity has provoked us to respond We must emphasize however that we do not acknowledge any responsibility to address her bizarre accusations Morrison's web-text I was a Ccru meat-puppet was purportedly transcribed faithfully from a live address given to the South London Monarch-Victims Support Group November 3rd 2002 We have reproduced it here without abridgement or alteration with Ccru's own comments at the end I was a Ccru Meat Puppet Justine Morrison This testament is intended as a warning It is addressed to those whose eyes and ears and minds can be opened Hope lies with those people those brave souls who dare to look And if my experiences have taught me anything it is that there is always hope no matter how dark and desperate things may seem Many many people around the world are learning to open their eyes I know that some of you here will open your eyes this evening Don't underestimate your power and importance With each new pair of eyes that can see we grow stronger and the Evil retreats It depends on not being looked at on not being seen for what it is You wouldn't be here unless you had already question the Lie So the fact you here at all is a cause for hope Many of the things I will tell you will seem unbelievable at first Many of you will think that the events I will describe could not possibly have happened Some of you will think that I am crazy You know what That is exactly what I would have thought a few years ago Yes that's exactly what I would have thought even though many of those atrocious unbelievable things had already happened to me personally You see when something very atrocious happens to you you can't remember it You screen it out in order to survive That's what they count on They feed on your disbelief They want to make it impossible for you to believe that they exist at all That's how they operate This is a critical time in our struggle Things are dark and desperate now Believe me Things are more dark and desperate than you could ever imagine They are playing out on the biggest possible stage The biggest possible the whole human race is at risk I wish I was exaggerating You know they are getting more and more sure of themselves They are passing messages on the grandest possible scale and they do not even feel the need to encrypt them very much It's better with the butterfly Can you imagine how I felt when I saw that slogan for the first time The biggest software company in the world announces the upgrading its online network with a strapline that was specifically addressed to me whom they called Assassin 8 When I saw those words I just froze Thankfully I have come so far in my recovery now that I did not succumb to panic I realized that this sign was as much a cause of hope as a reason to fear They had gained a new confidence in showing themselves The war was entering another phase So be it It's better with the butterfly Don't believe it for a second It will be worse Far far worse The MSN8 campaign is a sign that my former handlers a group calling itself the Ccru has taken control of the emerging planet-mind This should make you very scared indeed My tale is easier to tell because of the brave and honest trailblazing done by Cathy O'Brien It is Cathy who has done most to expose the monstrous evil of the Monarch program Every American in fact every concerned citizen of the world needs to read her book Trance-Formation of America Presumably many of you are here today because you have already read it For the benefit of those of you who haven't read Cathy's work I must pause and explain a little about what the Monarch Program is Those who know a little about it will have to excuse the fact that my initial explanation of Monarch will be very short Some might think it is misleadingly short Perhaps this is so But to consider Monarch in all its aspects would take much longer than the time I have available today The Monarch program is a mind control program It is named after the Monarch butterfly because just as the butterfly changes its form metamorphoses so the controllers trance-form the mind and personality of their subjects Monarch recruits its victims when they are children usually with the collusion of their parents It uses what is known as trauma-based mind control to condition its victims Very briefly this involves subjecting the children to stimuli so horrible so overwhelming that their psyche disintegrates The children cannot deal with what they have experienced so their personality breaks down into so-called alters submerged fragmentary personae that can be called up and trained by the controllers to carry out their evil purposes Who is behind this program Well it is known to have been operating in Nazi Germany during the Third Reich and later to have been adopted by an offshoot of the CIA called MK Ultra But these agencies are only masks for the forces the Satanic forces that are really in control The question for which the whole world should demand an answer is this Why does Ccru refuse to acknowledge its history of Monarch Program involvement even today No doubt many of you will be asking what is Ccru Even those of you who already know about Monarch might not yet know about Ccru and its role within the program I knew nothing of Ccru until I came across the name in publicity material for their Syzygy or occult twins festival in London The name Ccru was strangely familiar to me and I had no idea why It was not merely familiar it was powerfully and unpleasantly evocative The moment I saw the posters and leaflets I felt disoriented and threatened by an upwelling panic I couldn't explain That night I was tormented by senseless terrifyingly vivid dreams Each of the dreams took place in an immense desolate cavern I felt that I was drugged or restrained or both Either way I could not move The cavern was very dark lit only by candles and I could see almost nothing apart from row after row of symbols chalked onto the walls This was unnerving enough but what still terrorized me when I awoke from the dreams were the horrible sounds that resonated in the cavern there was a disconcerting continuous chanting but worse than that a deep moaning that seemed to issue from the throat of some vast unearthly creature These dreams were so vivid that they did not seem like dreams at all They seemed more like someone else's memories Although I had every reason to flee this macabre phenomenon I found that I could not Instead I was drawn inwards as if I had a destined role to play I had originally planned to remain in London for only a week or so But now I decided to stay longer until at least the start of the Syzygy festival In the end it turned out that I stayed for the whole thing Ccru's contributions to Syzygy had taken the form of nightly rituals dedicated to what they openly called demons Night after night the theme of twins and twinning recurred At this time part of me still thought that this was still some kind of art prank But the nightly rituals and readings were performed with what appeared to be total seriousness And every day after the official events finished there were long involved discussions that lasted deep into the night None of the Ccru controllers ever seemed to sleep It was in these discussion sessions that I learned more about the Ccru's belief systems They claimed to be waging an endless war against the oppressive forces of normal social existence In general they seemed wary and paranoid yet with me they seemed peculiarly trusting and eager to share their esoteric knowledge as if recognizing a long lost and sorely missed accomplice In fact Ccru seized upon me with an eagerness that should have been distressing except my sense of judgment had already decayed too far for that They claimed that ordinary social reality maintained the power of what they called Atlantean White Magic a kind of elite conspiracy which they said had secretly controlled the planet for millennia They claimed to traffick with demons who had told them many secrets drawn from a Lemurian tradition of time-sorcery that contained within itself everything that was and will be Lemuria was supposedly an ancient sorcerous culture populated by nonhuman beings Ccru also said that they had been taught to count by a sea-beast called Nomo which they had first summoned during an elaborate ritual with took place in Western Sumatra It was clear to me from the unspoken undercurrent that human sacrifice had been involved probably on a massive scale Their apparent indifference to such suffering fitted in with a general loathing for human existence itself They celebrated what they saw as the imminent destruction of humanity by the forces of techno-capitalism Were these just stories or did they really believe in what they were saying When I pressed them on this they never gave me a straight answer They kept saying that I needed to learn that reality was itself a type of fiction that both belief and disbelief had to be left behind I realize now that this was part of a deliberate strategy to mentally destabilize me At the dead center of the Ccru system was the Pandemonium Matrix It is difficult to fully describe what this horrible thing is It was only later when I had escaped Ccru's influence that its real nature was made clear to me What the Matrix amounted to was a list of the demon-creatures which the Lemurian sorcerers had traded and made pacts with More than that the Matrix gave the numerical codes and other protocols that the Lemurians had used to contact these entities I quickly learned the names and characteristics of many of these beings I noticed that one seemed to be invoked more frequently than the others Katak a demon associated with terrible destruction and desolation Night after night I ingested this Ccru spiritual poison not realizing or even really caring how thoroughly it was insidiously eroding the basic fabric of my being calling to my own inner demons I didn't know just how close I was to total destruction and wouldn't have known were it not for what had happened on the last night of Syzygy This night was devoted to what Ccru called a summoning but it's clear to me now that it was some form of hideous black Mass After it had drawn to a close I had a strong impulse to step outside for some fresh air Once outside I was vaguely aware of two trenchcoated figures lingering in the darkness Then things started to happen quickly Before I had time to react one of them had grabbed me covering my mouth at the same time the other pulled a hypodermic syringe from his coat pocket and quickly pushed it into my arm I realized immediately that they had drugged me Sedated but still conscious I was dragged for what seemed like hours through the alleys of Vauxhall Eventually we arrived at what appeared to be a warehouse of some kind I remembered being taken through a series of security doors until finally we entered a large basement area It was here that I was to spend six months of shattering revelation My two rescuers although it took me several weeks to properly identify them as such were twin brothers Viktor and Sergei Kowalsky who displayed all the heroism nobility and truthfulness of modern knights They themselves had escaped from a Soviet mind-control facility controlled by Russian Satanists After years of being pursued by agents from the most occult wing of the KGB the Kowalskys set up the base in London and there they waged their selfless crusade against the evil of Satanic mind control The months I spent in the Kowalskys deprogramming laboratory they called it a safe room were undoubtedly the most illuminating of my life Their therapeutic regime included hypnosis drugs and electrical stimulation The Kowalskys explained that these techniques were aimed at recovering material buried deep within my mind They were specially designed to restore the identity of what they described as Monarch slaves a term that was then completely new to me The Kowalskys told me that they needed to access the alternate personalities or Alters who had been with me since childhood They said that I had been subject to pandemonium programming a special variant of the Monarch system of personality disintegration compartmentalization and indoctrination The particular numerical combinations of the Pandemonium Matrix the Kowalskys told me had functioned as triggers for my suppressed identity fragments They warned me that digging down through these deeply-compacted layers of trauma would produce inexpressible intensities of anguish In telling me this they were not exaggerating in the slightest Over the following terrible months I would discover that my memories were lies my mind had literally ceased to be my own and that I had been possessed instead by alien commands and demons Who had been doing this to me and why It was only as my recovery work with the Kowalskys painfully advanced step by step that I came to understand the sinister purpose that held me in its claws The Kowalskys explained that Ccru wasn't an acronym at all but was actually a version of the ancient West-Polynesian word Khru meaning the Devil of Apocalypse Once I understood that they were really Satan worshippers a lot of other things became much clearer The supposed Lemurian system was really a name for all the demons of hell Ccru's role as agents of Satanic mind control explained the pedantically detailed theory of trauma they had outlined to me and also their striking obsession with twins In the world in which Ccru operated traumatism was the means and twins the raw material It was only by the most heroic and persistent efforts that the Kowalskys had initiated me into this aspect of the phenomenon In particular it took months for me to fully accept that what felt like vivid personal memories were actually telepathic communications from the submerged mental compartments of my missing Monarch twin The Kowalskys told me that my recent involvement with Ccru far from being accidental was the final stage of a long entanglement with them and the forces they represented Recovered memories from my early childhood showed that Ccru had been covertly directing the course of my entire life education and process of psychological maturation I had been chosen from before birth assigned to them by the ancient breeding masters countless generations before and had undergone meticulous lifelong training to perform a special mission I shuddered at the thought of what this mission would involve The Kowalskys gradually brought me to the terrible realization that my mission had already been accomplished on the very night of my rescue They told me that with my mission complete I had been scheduled for retirement only hours later This retirement would involve a long and protracted ceremonial death to be followed by a ritual devouring by the demon Katak A physical death and then a soul death But what had my mission been As the therapy progressed I crossed a new threshold in my recovery and became subject to a new wave of horribly realistic dreams It was in these dreams that the awful truth about the mission was revealed They began with a semi-familiar stranger leading me forcibly into the subterranean labyrinth beneath a tropical island After violating me repeatedly in the butterfly position he took me down into the lepidoptera hall It was long and narrow walled by shelves of meticulously numbered jars Each jar contained a butterfly At first I thought they were preserved specimens until I noticed them moving slightly opening and closing their wings Why don't they die I asked They can't die while the puppet lives he replied It was then that I noticed shocked that he was standing behind himself I heard cryptic numerical chanting in the background Then the rear figure commanded Do it now The chanting had changed into the insistent words Assassin 8 Assassinate Assassin 8 Assassinate I looked down and saw the number 8 was painted onto my chest in blood Then I saw myself standing over a bloody corpse laid out upon some kind of sacrificial altar In a moment of sickening revelation I recognized that the body was that of William Gates III Of course my initial response was to deny the possibility that I could be a murderer Surely this was some sick fantasy Wasn't Bill Gates manifestly alive and prosperous even appearing frequently on TV The Kowalskys were forced to puncture this bubble of comforting illusion How likely was it that this was actually the true Bill Gates The Kowalskys taught me that the probability was indeed vanishingly insignificant Not only did they point out all the subtle distinguishing features so that after comparing video images I could distinguish between Gates and his double with close to one hundred percent accuracy they also explained how for political reasons Gates continued existence had become impossible It was then that I recalled how every Syzygy night without fail the same slightly odd-looking middle-aged woman would attend wearing a shapeless raincoat an unnatural blonde beehive dark glasses and an ornate butterfly tiara She sat silently observing proceedings her features twisted into a cruel and complacent smile Recalling this mysterious visitor later with the help of the Kowalskys I was able to strip away the disguise and realize who she had been none other than Microsoft mastermind Bill Gates or more probably his twin On other occasions the Gates-entity wore different disguises in order to attend Ccru meetings without attracting attention yet he was never without a butterfly jewel of some kind a tiepin for instance or a ring On one occasion he appeared masquerading as the black-snow bluesman Blind Humpty Johnson I intuitively felt it had to be him but I could not see the emblem anywhere Eventually I chanced to glimpse into the left lens of his expensive shades and saw deep in the black mirror a holographic butterfly fluttering endlessly through the void It all made a terrible kind of sense but understandably I reacted very badly to the discovery The Kowalskys told me that this was probably because Gates had been involved with me in earlier episodes of satanic abuse and that recognizing him had threatened to reactivate unbearable repressed memories They told me that it would help to acknowledge these previous encounters so that I could begin the process of healing In any case there was no longer any doubt about the truth Gates was dead and I had murdered him With Gates death Microsoft and Ccru had become one thing I realized how completely I had misunderstood the situation Ccru had given every indication of holding Gates in awe following his instructions without question Among themselves they would use many affectionate names for him such as Dollar Bill the Gator and Gates of Pandemonium He had seemed like a kind of father figure to them How could the Ccru web-site have come to generate some of the heaviest traffic on the web without any advertising or even word-of-mouth popularization if not for the massive and sustained support offered by Gates and Microsoft Many web users report that the Ccru site sometimes pops up spontaneously when using certain Microsoft applications Ccru went to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their close links with Gates were never exposed even going so far as to attack him publicly Now of course I saw that the very name Syzygy had been a cynical declaration of black ritual assassination One twin would kill another This was typical of the brazen Ccru style years before Ccru had spoken of the Switch They had also publicly announced that the Age of Katak was arriving when the world would be consumed by blood and fire The assassination of Gates was supposed to initiate this new era The Kowalskys explained that Gates was the romanized version of the proto-Arabic Khatzeik the form of the name Katak as recorded on the Black Stele in the ruins of Irem Killing Gates was both a symbolic and a practical act that would enable Ccru to take control of cyberspace and use it for the vast planetary hive-mind control system that they are creating The letters MSN followed by the butterfly icon signifies Mission Butterfly or Monarch Program I never really understood their numbo-jumbo but they showed me that MSN8 was qabbalistically equivalent to CCRU I can't remember how it worked now but it was very persuasive at the time After the MSN8 campaign broke I wrote to Ccru asking them to justify their actions It was the first time I had attempted to contact them since my healing They were unable or unwilling to reply According to the Kowalskys Ccru were almost certainly Monarch slaves themselves That was why they could so convincingly feign oblivion about their involvement in the conspiracy as if they had no knowledge of the way the secret control-codes really operated I said before that these are dark days Indeed they are It is impossible to overstate the threat that Ccru and Monarch pose My purpose here tonight is to draw the world's attention to that To open your eyes Because to confront the Satanic threat you must accept that it is here You have to believe the unbelievable But speaking as a former Monarch slave myself I would urge caution To really defeat the Satanists we must learn everything we can about them Ccru should be deprogrammed with the same compassionate thoroughness that I was Ccru Commentary Confronted with the fantastic tales of Project Monarch even the most tenuous sanity recoils in revulsion from such patent lunacy whilst nevertheless remaining ensnarled in sticky threads of credible evidence extracted from the shadowy basements of state intelligence agencies Nazi eugenic and mind control experimentation is quite extensively documented Heinrich Himmler's Lebensborn breeding program concentration camp research deliberately induced trauma and obsession with twins is part of the historical record It is also relatively uncontestable that as Project Monarch exposures contend much of this work was transferred into the hands of American agencies through Project Paperclip Later CIA mind control experimentation such as the notorious MK Ultra program disclosed in documents released by the agency in 1977 exhibits certain continuities with the Nazi research goals Soviet-based work on mind control torture and interrogation techniques substantially mirrors the US cold war activities Morrison like O'Brien before her draws upon random patches of this legacy to weave a Byzantine tale of world-wide conspiracy in which she herself takes a starring role Like all conspiracy fictions hers is spun out of an all-encompassing narrative that cannot possibly be falsified because they want you to believe in their non-existence To attempt to refute such narratives is to be drawn into a tedious double game One either has to embrace an arbitrary and outrageous cosmic plot in which everything is being run by the Jews Masons Illuminati CIA Microsoft Satan Ccru or alternatively advocate submission to the most mundane construction of quotidian reality dismissing the hyperstitional chaos that operates beyond the screens cosmological dark matter and dark energy virtual imperceptible unknown This is why atheism is usually so boring Both conspiracy and common sense the normal reality script depend on the dialectical side of the double game on reflective twins belief and disbelief because disbelief is merely the negative complement of belief cancellation of the provocation disintensification neutralization of stimulus providing a metabolic yawn-break in the double-game Unbelief escapes all this by building a plane of potentiality upon which the annihilation of judgment converges with real cosmic indeterminacy For the demons of unbelief there is no monarch programming except as a side-effect of initiatory Monarch deprogramming Monarch Paranoia Ccru denies it was ever part of the program It denies there ever was a program until the deprogramming process introduced it Deprogramming simultaneously retro-produced the program just as witch-trials preceded devil-worship and regressive hypnotherapy preceded false memory syndrome Yet once these fictions are produced they function in and as reality It isn't that belief in Project Monarch produces the Monarch Program but rather that such belief produces equivalent effects to those the reality of Project Monarch would produce including some that are extremely peculiar and counter-intuitive Within the paranoid mode of the double game even twins are turned so as to confirm a persecutory unity that of the puppet master the reflection of God the Monarch How absurd to imagine that Lemurian Pandemonium has One purpose or function or that it could support the throne of a Monarch From the perspective of Pandemonium gods and their conspiracies emerge all over the place in countless numbers My name is Legion for we are many Unity is only ever a project a teleological aspiration never a real presupposition or actual foundation Monarch paranoia is primordially an allergic panic response to seething teeming Pandemonic multiplicity Everywhere it looks it finds the same enemy the Rorschach-blotted hallucinations of the Evil One masked deliriously in its myriads of deviations digressions and discrepancies In the hands of Justine Morrison Monarch Paranoia is an overt attempt to overcode Lemurian polyculture through the attribution of unitary purpose reducing it to the White Atlantean theme Ccru denounces this endeavor in the strongest possible terms We are forced to admit however that Morrison's comments on Microsoft Bill Gates and MSN8 latch on to a number of intriguing phenomena worthy of further intense investigation Whoever or whatever hatched the MSN8 campaign evidently emerged from a zone far beyond the commonly accepted domain of corporate influence and control For a US300 million advertising campaign to feature a grotesque insectoid Übermensch and for it to be widely accused of Satanism are sufficiently abnormal occurrences to merit serious attention Whilst strenuously denying intimate involvement with Bill or the Microsoft corporation the Ccru is in a position to confirm the qabbalistic affinity between its own name and the latest MSN product that Morrison alludes to MSN8 81 CCRU Our provisional hypothesis is that the company accidentally summoned something from beyond the spheres with a call sign it does not understand In this regard Microsoft personnel are not puppet masters but only puppets The same may indeed be true of Justine Morrison and even of the Ccru but no Monarch is pulling the strings";
