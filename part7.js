cybergothic = "Part-7 Cybergothic Fall-out from the soft apocalypse Y2K Letter Dr Melanie Newton MBug Study Group Cybernetic Culture Research Unit 39 The Parade Leamington Spa CV32 4BL 01926 313 395 email melanieccrudemoncouk The Editor The Sunday Times 1 Pennington Street London EI 9XW February 16 1998 Dear Sir The cultural vacuum at the heart of the Millennium Dome project becomes clearer by the week The absence of any serious consideration of time from discussion of Dome content is all the more astonishing given the Greenwich site Amongst those involved in the organization of this extravagant monument can there really be no one in any way stimulated by the unparalleled historical riches concentrated at the zero-meridian Surely the fascinating story of chronometry horology astronomy and navigation has some relevance to an event that centrally concerns international conventions of time-keeping and measurement Meanwhile computers are set to celebrate AD 2000 in their own way by returning to 00 and erasing the twentieth century It could reasonably be argued that since Cyberspace dates are incapable of counting above 99 -information technology has surreptitiously installed the first intrinsically apocalyptic calendar in history It would be ironic if the neglected issues of clocks and calendars found an avenging angel in the so called millennium time bomb plunging the opening of the Dome into darkness and electronic malfunction Yours faithfully Dr Melanie Newton Ccru Y2paniK Melanie Newton On receiving an interrupt decrement the counter to zero William Gibson Count Zero Millennial Mania reaches a certain peak in the Jerusalem syndrome which exhibits eschatourism as one element in the programmatic fulfillment of prophecy Whilst TV evangelists in the USA are exhorting viewers to sell all possessions and flock to Jerusalem and a papal blessing is promised to those visiting the holy-land at the beginning of the new millennium the Israeli tourist board security forces and the psychiatric profession are preparing for the arrival of up to thirteen million Christian pilgrims An abnormally high rate of psychotic disturbance is confidently anticipated perhaps succeeded by episodes of mass suicide amongst disillusioned believers At Megiddo the biblical Armegeddon they are planning the ultimate sound and light show involving frog-monsters the greatest earthquake in history and toxic hail from heaven Rev-XVI16 Such incendiary visions dove-tails neatly with existing regional tensions In preparation for the millennium various Jewish and Christian groups are plotting to demolish the El-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock This is seen as the necessary prelude to rebuilding the Third and final Temple of Solomon which would lay the mundane foundations for the New Jerusalem and induce the coming of the Messiah completion of Oecumenon Meanwhile infotechnics is carried by Y2K into millennial spasms of its own returning to 00 and digitally erasing the twentieth century reducing data to MMbojumbo Since Cyberspace dates are incapable of counting above 99 they have surreptitiously installed the first intrinsically apocalyptic calendar in history unconsciously produced within a planetrary electronic registry starting from Year Zero 00 Y2K condenses out of the mechanomic unconscious and its nonarbitrary calcular functions attesting to a raw decimal delirium indifferent to creed Post-tribulationist eschatology slides smoothly into Y2K survivalism orienting its volatile mixture of stock piling micro-militia activity technophobia and apocalyptic theology towards the self-fulfilling dynamics of millennial threat Pre-emptive response produces reality panic is creation The more you know about it the worse it looks It has always been integral to capitalist organization that science-fiction functions as a factor of production relating it intimately to panic-phenomena Y2K takes things to a new level as a disaster that comes from the future scheduled by accident and thus precisely anticipated in time If it proves effectively ineradicable it is because it is trickling back from the self-confirming inevitability of its occurrence Something is about to happen and we know exactly when The contours of the expected calamity are being continuously upscaled in conformity with an interlocking technopanic syndrome involving innumerable accidents various network crashes and elements of medical overstretch financial chaos transport telecommunication and power failures food and water shortages disruption of government services hoarding rioting and terrorism A number of governments have openly expressed their willingness to oversee millennium celebrations in conditions approximating to martial law Army and police leave is being cancelled and emergency services prepared for exceptional conditions including large-scale disruption of their own command control and communications systems compounded by widespread equipment dysfunction In the West large government and corporate bureaucracies are triaging their Y2K vulnerability writing-off the most expendable sectors accepting incalculable risk in others and concentrating resources solely on the most critical areas such as nuclear installations strategic control core information functions and financial records Forecasting the pattern of Y2K devastation is complicated by its artificial nature which explodes in spirals As a highly chaotic singularity it is characterized by extreme sensitivity to microvariables the absence of precedent and anticipatory looping through its own potentials It occurs in advance of itself punctually switches to an unknown climate and spreads contagiously through networks Modeling it adds complexity and noise which feed it Though entirely semiotic it already amounts to the most expensive accident in history whatever happens 36 trillion and counting Y2K produces a traumatic mutation in the information economy involving an explosion of IT emergency services analysis debugging integrated solutions massively accelerated hardware replacement global restructuring and a crisis of confidence in computer-supported services with the potential to runaway into general market collapse It interrupts the smooth upward curve of doubling microprocessor density falling prices and increasing market-penetration with a singular cyberspace-shock that is discontinuous or nonmetabolic in nature Junk-shops stack-up with prematurely discarded infotechnic hardware providing the material-base for a computer-age skip-scavenging cargo-culture Electronics must be subsocially recycled to release its frozen machinic potential Cyberpunk begins with Y2K Outside the public sphere Y2K excitement is not only higher it has changed phase entirely As hysterical hyperlooping twists the millennium into a panic storm it builds explosively on itself producing an artificial destiny Techonomic power splinters across schizophrenically juxtaposed time-systems spawning monsters the first true counterculture Lurking predominantly in the datacombs of the crypt numerous shadowy groups now proclaim themselves Y2K-positive These Yettuk cults have begun building a mesh of massively decentralized subcultural impulses directly investing ethnotronic time-catastrophe and aggressively promoting chronodissidence throughout and beyond the web They celebrate Y2K as a threat to the order of time a cultural event that is not textual ideological representational intentional or phenomenological but rather machinic and numerical-subtractive n 1 Y2K designates a crisis of calendric culture a time-bomb so perfected that the timer is the bomb It simultaneously adopts the zero-function of 24-hour digital time-code induces convergence with the calendric zero of count-inception dismantles clock calendar segmentarity into flat scales of duration and triggers Teotwawki Even when it operates pre-emptively in any number of ways it refers itself to the punctual Great Midnight that cuts hyperhistorical time-continuum at 0000 doubling the retro-virtual chronogenesis of the century Y2K is as old as computers all that changes is the panic intensity According to the Yettuk cultists or K-Goths the total chronopolitical immune-response to Y2K constitutes a program for Gregorian Restoration with the bug-hunt masking a neoroman sociopolitical agenda Far from being a mere technical glitch the millennium time crisis indexes the first neutral calendar in history which escapes the numerocultural legacy of the Romans by beginning with a year 0 00 The demand for millennium compliance attempts to enforce the abandonment of an existing calendar that of cybernetic- or K-Time and suppress its associated time-anomalies sealing the calendar against zero In the now notorious words of crypt denizen Count S Zero so Mbug resistors think MATRIX needs a new calendar totally steam-punk Wake up ITs already KTime Count-O Greg Date 1900 What Didn't Happen at the Millennium Iris Carver is at first amused to discover that the cybergoths treat her as a fiction Numerous Crypt-texts describe her near-future adventures in hallucinatory detail especially when they intersect with the dark stream of Sarkon legend Naturally enough she intensifies her time-cult research When she finally meets Sarkon in 2004 she has forgotten almost everything Pandemonium What didn't Happen at the Millennium There was something peculiar about writing this book At times she thought it would never be finished The Sarkon stories had been full of holes which added to the confusion Eventually she started making things up but even that became entangled with coincidence and with Cybergoth hyperstition assembled from fictional quantities which make themselves real She had found herself investigating various neolemurian cults most of whom anticipated something huge around about the 1999 Spring-Equinox when Pluto exits from the clutch of Neptune triggering the return of the Old Ones By the end of the century things had been so wound-up by Yettuk apocalypticism that even the most extravagant socioeconomic turmoil would still have been a disappointment And yet now four years after the millennium the sense of anticlimax had begun to seem strangely artificial as if it were screening something out Carver has made her whole life out of hyperstition even her name is a pseudonym She continuously returns to the imperceptible crossing where fiction becomes time-travel and the only patterns are coincidences Her notes on the Sarkon meeting pulse with Lemurian sorceries demonic swarms ageless time-wars and searches for the Limbic-Key She navigates Moebian circuits feeling that a vaguely recollected rumour is still about to occur Appendix Penultimillennial Crypt-Cults Characteristics 1 flatline Materialism The Crypt is nothing outside an experiment in artificial death hyper-production of the positive zero-plane neuroelectonic immanence invested by a continually re-animated thanatechnical connectivism This fact carries inevitable consequences for the cultures that populate it uprooting them into Unlife or the non-zone of absolute betweenness whose spirodynamics of sorcerous involvement are alone sufficient to reach the sub-mesh tracts of cybergothic continuum flatline Materialism designates the objectless Crypt-voyage itself as Lemurian body-fusion at matter degree-zero 2 Digital Hyperstition Nothing propagates itself through the Crypt without realizing the operational identity of culture and machinery effectively dismantling the organic body into numerizing particles which swarm in dislocated swirls Crypt-entities are both hyper-vortical singularities and units of Digital Hyperstition or brands of the Outside real components of numerical fictions that make themselves real providing the practical matter of sorcery spirogenesis or productive involvement that function consistently with the flatline Crypt-cultures know nothing of work or meaning Instead they coincide with the hype-spirals Cyberhype that flattens signs and resources onto non-signifying triggers diagrams and assembly jargons 3 Lesbovampiric Contagion-Libido Crypt-sorcery makes itself real in the same way that it spreads Functioning as a plague it associates with the experimental production of an anticlimactic or anorgasmic counter-sexuality attuned to the collective re-engineering of bodies within technobiotic assemblages ultimately composed of electronic streams or ionic currents in their sense of positive hole-flow Since Crypt-sex is precisely identical to the infections it transmits counted in bodyshifting vectors its libidinal composition is marked both by a palaeoembryonic or oestrogenetic non-gendered femininity and a lateral haemometallic influenzoid virulence 4 Y2K-Positive Calendric Agitation Crypt-cultures spill into the closed economy of history through a rupture in chronological ordering punctually triggered at Time-Zero Crypt-rumour consistently allocates its own contemporary emergence or unearthing to impending millennial Cyberschiz Cyberspace time-disintegration under the strategically aggravated impact of Y2K-missile Whilst multiply differentiated most crucially by the division between continuism and centience Crypt-cults are constitutively involved in a singular nexus of counter-Gregorian calendric subversion celebrating the automatic redating of the machinic unconscious and hyping the dissolution of commemorative significance into digital time-mutation catalyzed by numerical and indexical operative signals The Crypt exists from before the origin of time but it begins at Year-Zero Cybergothic Hyperstition Fast-Forward to the Old Ones Iris Carver 1998 Think of Cyberspace as a black-mirror It is where time flips over collide with it and you travel backwards As telecommerce accelerates us into the net it seems that things of ever deeper antiquity awaken and begin their return So say the Cybergoths Cybergothic exists as a web of sinister rumour haunting a subterranean softlabyrinth which it calls the Crypt Buried deep within the primal sediment of the infoplex and shrouded in a crawling-fog of digital camouflage it isn't easy to find but there are clues Initiates of the late 90s Darkside Catajungle scene will remember Crypt we're not a band but a pack as the lesbovampire mix-down sound-machine based around Gill Slitz and Jean Trafix Their 1997 Unlife CD a necrotic-rush of vortical tickdrifts and abysmal bass set the tone for a wave of post-musical electro-thanatoid polyrhythm production punk-nihilism updated into a technodesolated Nanofuture It's a Wintermutant thing Slitz declared Basically we're a nightmare Hyperstitions are not representations neither disinformation nor mythology Hype hyping hyperpropagation belongs to a strain of time-warp cybernetic fiction that cannot be judged true or false because it makes itself real Trawl through the nether-regions of Cyberspace and the Crypt-influence is vivid Unlife is spreading and with it the ominous themes of time-rupture social heatdeath synthetic culture-plague artificial-drug addictions immersion-coma and cryo-tomb scavenging ameiotic or bacteriosexual retroversion ghoul-oriented behavior spinal-catastrophism and aquapocalyptic neo-icthyoid body-shifting multiplicitous connections to all those horrible slimy tentacular abominations from the Outside Cybergothic Cargo-Culture patches itself together out of things that fall from the future cannibalizing them for ancient intensities which are propagated as hyperstitions It believes nothing but that's Uttunul which underlies everything and lies are fictional quantities Take Yettuk for example It's obviously made-up Yet it proves effectively ineradicable lurking in the most ancient substrata of programmable and embedded systems soft-relics from the punch-card epoch replicated mindlessly and encrypted in forgotten polyglot-codes Something is about to occur and we know exactly when Whether the looming entity is called Y2K Yet-Tick You-Took K-Yeti Yettuk or Yatka the cybergoths interact with it as a chronsensitive electrophantom a binomic cloud coincident with the double-zero time-fault that quakes the millennium Cybergothic is preparing itself for the coming time-war intertrafficking amongst various xenochronic mystics countergregorian agitators and calendric-guerrillas that populate the datacombs Out beyond the Yettuk-rift fierce K-dating subcultures spread across drowned continents of web-space Demonic multitudes are condensing in the Crypt The A-Death Phenomenon Iris Carver from Death-Traffic in Cyberspace Making a Killing on the Net Has death itself become a telecommodity A dark-tide of scare-stories and morbid rumour increasingly suggests so By the late 90s Leary's psychedelic utopianism seems to have contracted to the nihilistic slogan Turn-on to tune-out to cite a recent release by Catajungle outfit Xxignal this ain't Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll no more According to Doug Frushlee spokesman for the Christian Coalition for Natural Mortality The so-called A-Death menace is an almost unimaginable desecration of divine and natural law This craze is an abomination without parallel it trades on its intrinsic lethality and it's growing incredibly fast No one can say it isn't dangerous Something truly evil is happening to our youngsters something beyond 60s 666uality I've never been as frightened as I am now The result is an entire jungle of positive-zero fugues Thanatechnics Sarkolepsy Snuff-Stims K-Zombification Electrovampirism Necronomics Cthelllectronics Nine million ways to die A-Death is a hybrid product involving convergences between at least four distinct lines of rapid technocultural transformation A-Death combines micropause abuse deliberately reversed biotechmnesis with immersion-coma time aberrances generating modulating and rescaling sentience-holes Sarkon-lapses These are toned by Synatives artificial drugs which add zone-texture and spliced into hyperstition trances as occultural events Social statistics indicate that the typical A-Death user is fifteen years old Following the most ominous threads of A-Death reportage takes you inexorably down into the digital underworld of the Crypt the dark-twin of the net where gibsonian flatlining is rapidly transmuting from exotic fiction into pop-cult and masstransit system You could describe it as the route to contemporary shamanism suggest A-Death cultists of the cybergoth Late Abortion Club after all AOL spells Loa backwards but we call ourselves postvitalists How long have the Late Abortionists been active on the A-Death scene There are disturbing tales of K-Space zombie-makers sorcerors on the plane of virtual nightmare whose digital spine-biting centipedes yield the soft-tox juice that opens the limbic gates Crypt initiates confirm that its arterial access lowway is sign-posted Main-flatline under-construction Answers vary confusingly from extravagance round about sixty-six million years through vagueness some time to mystic compression since now In other respects accounts of the contemporary A-Death scene and its recent history prove remarkably consistent In particular the one name to turn up incessantly is that of Dr Oskar Sarkon biomechanician technogenius and one of the most controversial figures in scientific history Sarkon's polymathy is attested by the variety of fields to which he has centrally contributed including transfinite analysis neural-nets distributed computing swarm-robotics xenopsychology Axsys-engineering Yet it was the resolutely sober Oecumenist rather than for instance Frushlee's excitable End Times which dedicated the cover and major editorial of its March 98 issue to the question Sarkon Satan of Cyberspace Sarkon has become emblematic of the ways in which technological dreams go bad In the words of fellow Axsys researcher and social-thanatropist Dr Zeke Burns What makes Sarkon's input into the A-Death thing so incomparable is that it crosses between all of the key component technologies The biotechmnesis work is so outstanding that it tends to overshadow his equally pathbreaking research in adjacent fields The Sarkon-formulae for non-metric pausation for example which provided the first rigorous basis for IC immersion-coma control The links between biotechmnesis and IC weren't remotely anticipated before the Sarkon-zip which mathematically models bicontinual assemblages finally there's Synatives about which he is understandably evasive even though he was theorizing artificial or digital-neurotechnic pharmaceuticals in the mid-80s The aggregate result of all this pioneering science a generation of teenagers lost in schizotechnic death-cults Unscreened Matrix Once it was said that there are no shadows in Cyberspace Now Cyberspace has its own shadow its dark-twin the Crypt Cybergothic finds the deep-past in the near future In cthelllectronic fusion between digital data-systems and Iron-Ocean ionic seething it unearths something older than natural mortality something it calls Unlife or artificial-death Of A-Death there can be no lucid recollection but only suggestion seepage hints and it is by collating sifting and shuﬄing-together these disparate clues that a pattern can be induced to emerge a pattern which ultimately condenses into the looming tangled shapes of subtle but implacable destiny Sprawling beneath public cyberspace lies the labyrinthine underworld of the Datacombs ghost-stacks of sedimented virtuality spiralling down abysmally into palaeodigital soft-chatter from the punch-card regime through junk-programming forgotten cryptoccultures fossil-codes and dead-systems regressively decaying into the pseudomechanical clicking-relics of technotomb clockwork It is deeper still amongst the chthonic switchings cross-hatchings and spectral-diagrammatics of unborn abstract-machines that you pick-up the Main-flatline into the Crypt The Crypt is a splitting a distance or departure and it is vast Nested into the cascading tick-shelves it propagates by contagion implexing itself through intricate terraces galleries ducts and crawl-tubes as if an extraterrestrial megamodule had impacted into the chalk-out data-cliffs spattering them with scorch-punctures and intestinally complicated iridium body-parts As it pulses squirms and chitters to the inhuman rhythms of ceaseless K-Goth carnival it reminds you that Catajungle was never reducible to a sonic subgenre but was always also a terrain a sub-Cartesian region of intensive diagonals cutting through nongeometric space where time unthreads into warped voyages splintering the soul Contemplating these immense vistas it seems woundingly implausible that they are mere simulation supported by quantic electron distribution in the telecommercial fabric Down here it makes more sense the other way from the Outside or Lemuria Strip-out everything human significant subjective or organic and you approach raw K- Matrix the limit-plane of continuous cessation or Unlife where cosmic reality constructs itself without presupposition in advance of any natural order and exterior to established structures of time On this plane you are impossible and because it has no end you will find will have ultimately always found that you cannot be except as a figment of terminal passage an illusion of waiting to be changed for Cthulhoid-continuum of destratified hypermatter at zero-intensity That is what A-Death traffic accesses and what is announced by the burnt-meat smell freighted with horrible compulsion that drifts up to you from the Zombie-dens So you continue your descent into the Crypt-core scavenging for an A-Death hit As you pass erratically through exchanges participations and partial-coalescences with the ghoul-packs of the periphery you change Swarms and shoals include you drawing you into collective fluencies tidal motions and the tropisms of multiplicity You shed language like dry-skin and your fear becomes peculiarly abstracted metamorphosing into the tranquil horror of inevitability You pass across tiered platforms and along strobe-corridors painted in multilayered shadow passing swirling dot-drifts and plex-marks sub-chromatic coilings of blue-grey continuous variation involving you in cumulations and dispersions of subtly shifting semi-intelligent shade-pattern The teeming surfaces tell of things inextricable from a process of thinking that no longer seems your own but rather impersonal undertow in audible chattering click-hiss turmoil of xenomic diagrams and Crypt-culture traffic-signs which are also Lemurian pandemonium Order becomes uncertain It feels later Is it only now that you meet the Zombiemaker swathed in shimmering reptile-skin and obscenely eager to trade Oecumenic cash-money will do You sit in the coma-bay and wait A glimpse at the toxinflecked fangs of the giant thanatonic centipede consecrated to Ixidod then a sudden pain-jolt at the back of the neck where the spine plugs into the brain Instantaneous paralysis and crossing over Even if you thought it was the first time you remember The worst thing in the world Fake eternities of stationary descent to the impossible cross-cut by disintegrated furies of neuroelectric death-hurt An anonymous panic of inconceivable intensity swallowed by slow drowning until you are gone or stranded in a halo of intolerable feeling which is the same and cannot be so that what is forever caught in the dark Cthulhoid wave is a mere twist or fold of itself carried unresisting into immensities of real unbeing and nothing could ever happen except this So say the K-Goths The Unlife of the Earth Letter from Carl Gustav Jung to Echidna Stillwell Dated 27th February 1929 Extract your attachment to a Lemurian cultural-strain disturbs me intensely From my own point of view based on the three most difficult cases I have encountered and their attendant abysmally archaic symbolism it is no exaggeration to state that Lemuria condenses all that is most intrinsically horrific to the racial unconscious and that the true Lemurians who you seem intent upon rediscovering are best left buried beneath the sea I agree with the Theosophical writings at least this far it was in order that the darkest sorceries should be erased by deluge that this continent of cultural possibility has been placed under the unconscious sign of definitive submergence I know little enough about the nature of those that populated that cursed zone but there are things I suspect and the line of your own researches confirms my most ominous intimations There is no evidence of a reply to this letter Who were these three difficult cases One at least seems at least superficially to be readily identifiable as Heidi Kurzweil In September 1908 Kurzweil was detained in a secure psychiatric institution after the brutal murder of her twin brother in Geneva She seemed to have lost the ability to use the first-person pronoun and was diagnosed as suffering from Dementia Praecox or schizophrenia At her trial she repeatedly claimed We killed half to become one twin but it wasn't enough Jung took an early interest in the case and began a series of analytical sessions Kurzweil in Jung's journal and correspondence became Heidi K but after only five weeks he seems to have abandoned hope of progress and disengaged the analytic process After his third session with Heidi K exactly twenty years prior to his Stillwell letter on the 27th February 1909 Jung records the following words Dr Jung we know you are old in your other body It is as old as hell It has let you back but it sends us away It feels itself becoming Lemurian and it is definite unlife es ist bestimmt unleben There is nothing we would not do to escape Nothing Nothing Nothing But it is fate It howls electric bliss beneath our cells It is nowhere in time and nothings us It is the body of nothing and electric-hot An electric nothing-body instead of us In this instance at least there is little indication of the abysmally archaic symbolism Jung promises us On the contrary there is remarkable affinity with the hypermodern writings of K-Goth artificial death cultists documented elsewhere The K-Goth Crypt-texts share a marked preference for anonymous pronouns whether collective second- or third-person whilst spiralling about a nullifying electric-excruciation traversed in the name of Lemuria In the words of one anonymous Crypt-posting We burn each time but forget When we begin each time it comes back and no one would do it then but it is too late We cross over again into electric-burning but forget that it hurts in the brain to die this way It takes so long to learn that it is grating-apart and burning that dying is felt in the brain and that it is horrible It is so horrible to feel but then we forget so it can happen again Metal body-screaming to die in electricity Metallic microparticle sex that is of unlife and not the organism That is what the Zombie-maker brings with the digital centipede bite And we are hooked on it hooked up to it because coming the other way it is Lemuria Incessant intolerable feeling passing forever approaching from the outside and feeling nothing continuously The Tale of Centipede Some say there was a time when the dead were still In those days when anything died it was soon forgotten and no one knew or cared what became of it No one had heard of Ixidod at that time and whatever she did if anything at all was of no concern to anybody No one had heard of Centipede either who lived under a rock in secret All this changed one day or so it is said Ixidod whose perception was very keen spotted Centipede hunting creeping and hiding and thought to herself Centipede is so very cunning and silent together we could find out something no one else knows and learn the secrets of the dead It seems that Centipede must have agreed to Ixidod's plan because since that time the two of them have been inseparable and everyone crossing into the region of the dead has met Centipede on the way Centipede's fangs are now laden with the venom of Ixidod and that is called the nectar of dead-sense In any case it was only Oddubb lurking nearby who saw what truly passed between Ixidod and Centipede at that time and she is sworn to deathly silence about it or so she says";
