atlantis = "Part-4 Black Atlantis Submarine esotericism Hyper-C Afroatlantean themes have been reanimated in modern times by persistent suggestions that some of the human cargo lost on the middle-passage has transmuted into a neoaquatic species rediscovering the sunken continent In some versions of this mythos the mutant population ultimately launches an alien-invasion to reclaim the land In others they never need to surface since their surreptitious influence works from below the Guinea of the voodoo-cults from which the Loa swim-up From subversion to submersion In a series of cryptic communications the aquassassins of Hyper-C refer to an impending C-Change combining Afroatlantean mutation with time-dissidence They associate the implicit century of 2-digit computer dates with the Poseidonic pack 100 envisaging Y2K the Time-Bomb in Babylon as the surface symptom of a submergent call to Centience The Hyper-C Rite of Return counts down to 99 Rewind the Century no playback For this hypermodern cargo-cult there has only ever been the Century life has evolved in cyberspace and history is simulation format 19 With the realization of Centience the Time-Chains are broken Babylon Capital of fake-time is dragged down into the sea Bubbamu sinks Babylon The people of noiz-zion break the mirror and escape to the true century Set your clocks to maritime From Subversion to Submersion Galactic Bureau of Investigations report to the Galactic Federation on new sonic insurgencies As we approach the Millennium the Bureau has noted a marked increase in the activities of the enigmatic group known as Hyper-C Agents will be aware that HyperC is a clandestine distributed network dedicated to aquatic return and the liquidation of Babylon Hyper-C is associated in particular with sonic intelligence weaponry and has taken credit for many recent examples of info-terrorism which have been conventionally but erroneously labeled as musical recordings Question Who or what is behind the transmissions Is Hyper-C merely the name for a set of uncoordinated but related practices Do Hyper-C activities amount to anything more than the replication of the name Hyper-C As with most threats the Federation currently faces Hyper-C has abandoned all traditional political methods and goals it has seceded utterly from the representational and signifying regimes of the Dominant Operating System Operatives should be warned that Hyper-C propagates virally It would be extremely foolish and dangerous to think of this as a metaphor Even the use of the term Hyper-C in this report is a spreading of the virus Warning Agents must be aware that contact with Hyper-C tends to dissolve all conventional sense of reality The chief danger to Galactic Federation operatives may be that agents begin to question the reality of their mission in many cases operatives have been fooled into doubting the existence of the Federation A particularly nasty Hyper-C tactic involves treating the Federation as Science fiction As one reputed Hyper-C signal puts it Everything you see everything you hear it might be a mirage A complementary diversionary tactic involves denying the existence of Hyper-C itself Do not be fooled rumours and disinformation are indispensable weapons in ultramodern cybernetic conflicts Denying its own existence is one of the ways Hyper-C spreads In order to prepare agents for operating in the field it is necessary to describe some of the principal characteristics of Hyper-C activities These have been grouped under headings which have been taken from Hyper-C communiques On no account should operatives repeat these slogans they must be treated as highly contagious material One From subversion to submersion Agents should not assume that the absence of explicitly seditious signifying material from Hyper-C transmissions indicates that they are devoid of content or without effect On the contrary the fact that these transmissions in no way resemble excepted modes of political address is indicative of their extreme virulence The disassembly of music into sonic machineries has gone alongside the dissolution of politics into tactics The aspirational and representational logics of protest music have given way to a technics of direct action in which sound is used as a neuronic trigger Once again agents should not imagine that there is anything metaphorical about this Hyper C sonic weaponry is stealthy but highly effective it attacks the organism very directly opening up defensive membranes to an immersive acoustic space The abstraction of sound made possible by new technologies enables a hitherto unimaginable distribution of the secret coded rhythm patterns Hyper-C is dedicated to spreading Operatives should take special care with sonic strains labelled Wave-2 Detroit techno catajungle 2-step death garage sinofuturism Two We will never surface or the sonic minorities take to the shadows Hyper-C is said to model itself on the hunted animal not the hunter Hyper-C accordingly make no attempt to infiltrate or occupy the mediascape since as a previous GBI report has noted Hyper-C now has global strike capacity via Programmer digital communication systems Instead of deploying these digital communication systems to push a political program Hyper-C is constantly disappearing into a web of pirate communications and illicit marketization using the so-called Outernet to effectuate a virtual deletion of the social Three Set your clocks to maritime Hyper-C treats conventional chronology as fake time It has developed a sophisticated counter-chronic program involving an anti-Gregorian Y2K positive occupation of the so-called computer calendar an engineered reversal of mammalian evolution and a mystico-materialist critique of sequential causality Four Negative Evolution The attempt to escape fake time seems to take the form of spinal regression the projected dispersal of mammalian organismic integrity via a return down the evolutionary ladder As a previous GBI report warns when negative evolution is achieved human characteristics begin to fade and the voice becomes unrecognizable The recurrent reptilian and fish imagery should not be interpreted as something merely symbolic The Bureau has every reason to believe that Hyper-C activists are pursuing all available means to bring about a return to the icthiophidian flexomotile spine The Federation regards Hyper-C as one of the most serious threats to the stability of the Oecumenon These Aquassassins are a Lemurian weapon aimed at Human Security and it is a matter of urgency that their activities be undermined by any means necessary Channel Zero The Channel Zero black snow cult lurks among the ruins on the underside of cyberspace It is directed

snow Zelda Maria de Monterre Madame Centauri Sorceress 1904-2004 Zelda Maria de Monterre better known as Madame Centauri was born on December 23rd 1904 in Port-au-Prince Haiti Her father Pierre de Monterre was a French diplomat also suspected of being a professional spy and assassin Her mother Estelle Lavoissier was a respected botanist also reliably known to have been a Voodoo priestess The combination of her father's career and her mother's exotic researches meant that Zelda experienced an itinerant childhood traveling widely and almost continuously throughout the Francophone regions of the Caribbean Africa and East Asia In the fall of 1926 at the height of the Harlem Renaissance de Monterre arrived in New York to study drama at the Barakovsky School of the Performing Arts Among the many writers painters and musicians with whom she became involved at this time by far the most important was Zora Neale Hurston Originally fascinated by de Monterre's Haitian childhood and familiarity with voodoo rituals Hurston quite quickly became convinced de Monterre was the reincarnation of her mother who had died in 1904 Hurston carried out various tests to prove this hypothesis all of which de Monterre passed unambiguously Under Hurston's dazzling influence de Monterre was led to investigate the cultural secrets of her maternal lineage Together they committed themselves to the comprehensive excavation of Black Atlantean magical traditions During this same period de Monterre met and quickly married the AmericoLiberian writer and political activist Ktomo Otchoko author of the revolutionary manifesto The African Slaves of Atlantis 1927 This work beginning with the provocative line The glories of Atlantis were built upon the bodies of the black race was almost unimaginably offensive to the orthodox Atlantean establishment and was even said by some to have sealed Otchoko's fate In 1929 de Monterre gave birth to a daughter Aziza Isis who Otchoko would never meet At the time of his daughter's birth Otchoko was in Liberia engaged in ceaseless political campaigning Whether due to chance to his own impetuous carelessness or to the meticulous plans of sinister forces by the end of that year he was dead slain by a band of Kru guerillas in the jungle outside Monrovia Having lost her husband with an infant daughter and five cats to support de Monterre abandoned her acting career or according to some redirected it In the autumn of 1930 she opened an occult shop The Hoodoo Hut in central Harlem advertizing herself as a professional fortune teller cartomancer astrologer and spiritualist Perhaps inspired by Hurston's peculiar obsession she began to describe herself as the reincarnation of HP Blavatsky It was also during this period that Zelda Maria de Monterre began calling herself Madame Centauri often signing her name with the number 100 Her chosen name attested to a transformative discovery that was to illuminate her future path through the occulted regions After painstaking hermetic researches she had come to understand the vast significance of Alpha Centauri referred to as The Star to all Atlantean traditions Centauri herself associated this insight with the arrival of Logobubb a wise spirit of the Centaurean Diaspora invading telepathically from the year 2048 with whom she would enter into consistent communication In 1937 she completed her first major monograph Atlantean Schism describing the Centaurean Diaspora as a splitting of integrated Primordial-Atlantean Consciousness and outlined the quest to re-establish contact between astral and chthonic energies which she conceived as the root of Black Atlantean gnosis Centauri rapidly built a reputation as an occultist of extraordinary ability along with a distinguished client list As far as her own hermetic destiny was concerned by far the most consequential among these contracts was undoubtedly Captain Peter Vysparov who first came to the Hut in 1946 seeking cartomantic insight into his bizarre experiences among the Dibbomese Centauri's long and ambiguous relationship with Vysparov was to provide a gateway into the doctrines and ritualistic traditions of Orthodox Atlanteanism as well as opening the cobwebbed vaults of Atlantean Black Magic buried in the deep shadows beneath the Atlantean Cross With a shared interest in the supernatural fiction of HPLovecraft who was rumoured to have been a sporadic visitor to The Hoodoo Hut in the mid-1930s Centauri and Vysparov met for regular meetings of the Cthulhu Club which had been initially founded in Kingsport Massachusetts as a Lovecraft reading group and later became the principal intellectual vortex of post-war Hyperstitional and Neolemurian investigation Centauri's intellectual debt to Lovecraft is best expressed in her short work The True Cthulhu 1948 which attempted to establish the precise correspondence between Lovecraft's 36 sonnets and the Great Seals worked by 18th Century occultist August Barrow and thus implicitly with the 36 cards of the Decadence pack It was also through the Cthulhu Club that in 1949 Centauri came into contact with Echidna Stillwell Chaim Horowitz and the Lemurian Numogram These influences were nebulously manifested during the early 1950s when Centauri devoted herself to the intricate task of Lemuro-Atlantean synthesis formulated in her last completed book Loss of Atlantis 1956 This text attributed to the Logobubb channel was widely considered incomprehensible even among adepts of the dark arts due to its scale over 1000 pages extremely technical nature and enormous range of esoteric ethnographic material Loss of Atlantis explored the Decadence of the Sunken Continent whose Metatronic Tarot had fallen prey to its own unavowed Lemurian undertow Following the publication of Loss of Atlantis Centauri sold The Hut and moved to the family home of her maternal uncle recently deceased on the outskirts of New Orleans where she lived with her sister Cleo for the rest of her life From this new base she made frequent trips to Haiti partly following in the ethnographic footsteps of Hurston and partly so it was widely rumored waging magical war against the Duvalier dictatorship In the relative calm of Louisiana Centauri pushed ever further into her occult researches All the strands of her life came together in her Great Work as a decadologist which would centrally preoccupy her for the remaining half-century of her life The consummation of these extraordinary labors whose mere intimation had already revolutionized late-20th Century occultism was unveiled in a private ceremony held at the Vysparov Library in late November 1999 Fabulously illustrated under Centauri's exact telepathic instruction by deaf-mute idiot savante collaborator Bobo Matouche the Old Atlantean Tarot or Centauri Pack of decamantic cards definitively manifested the re-surfacing of Guinea through a rigorously modernized Black Atlantean Gnosis While building on the mid 18th century Barrow Pack Centauri's cards deviated into the Sinister Tradition of decimal cartomancy as exemplified by the Black Egyptian Pack or Pack of Set by including the four blanks or Queens required to perform subdecadence rituals Shortly before Centauri's death an abridged and limited edition of the notes diagrams and previously unpublished short articles produced during her many years of decadological research was released under the title Decadence of Atlantis Collected Decamantic Writings of Mme Centauri On the day before Christmas Eve 2004 Centauri's daughter and grand-daughters the quins gathered to celebrate her 100th birthday and perform what would be her final Decadence ritual which she read as Logobubb calling her to make the great crossing That night she died quietly in her sleep Even before her death Centauri's revival of Black Atlanteanism was being recognized as a major influence on Afrofuturism Explicit references to her work are most evident in contemporary Centience cults such as Hyper-C and in many recent classics of apocalyptic science-fiction such as William Gibson's Neuromancer Greg Bear's Queen of Angels and Octavia Butler's Clay's Ark Maximilian Crabbe Subaquatic researcher and entrepreneur 1940-1999 Max Crabbe was born in Lewes West Sussex UK on Mar 22nd 1940 during Britain's most critical war-time year His mother Caroline was the daughter of Vladimir Vysparov White Russian immigrant and reluctant inheritor of the notorious Vysparov Library His father Edward was a minor aristocrat whose stable of businesses in the financial and technological fields contributed significantly to British military intelligence in WWII and the Cold War supporting innovations in mechanical cryptography that stretched from a special unit at Bletchley Park to Axsys-related research in the US Max's rebellious tendencies were evident from an early age These culminated in Autumn 1957 with his expulsion from elite Sandwich College Wiltshire after an incident that apparently involved mescaline pagan rituals and a small-calibre handgun The following spring Max was sent to New York to stay with his uncle Peter Vysparov In New York Crabbe seems to have fallen under the sway of Vysparov's circle developing a passionate interest in Nma ethnography In June 1960 Crabbe traveled to Java to search for the remnants of the Dibboma Dib-N'ma people Exactly what happened to him in the pestilential swamps and jungles of Indonesia remains a matter of dark conjecture but it seems certain that the icthyophidian influences encountered on this expedition wormed their way deeply into his fate Crabbe returned from this sojourn shortly before year's end triumphantly bearing his own translation of a previously unknown sacred incantation to the polymorphic seabeast deity of the Nma the Nomo Chant Although throughout the 1960s and early 70s Crabbe surfed the edge of the counterculture involving himself in a variety of projects with figures such as Gregory Bateson John Lilly and Katy Shaw his inherited business-sense was unmistakably emerging By the late 1970s his interest in dolphin communication cybernetic oceanography and hydro-acoustics had been leveraged into corporate assets Crabbe Holdings amounting to an estimated US$27 billion Crabbe's growing reclusiveness took ever more extreme forms By the mid-'70s public appearances were almost nonexistent The last verifiable photograph taken in 1982 shows Crabbe floating in his technologically-enhanced private swimmingpool his image little more than a malformed shadowy blur In January 1980 Crabbe founded the Institute for the Study of Binomics appointing Katy Shaw as executive director The Crabbe Institute's 1996 Report on Calendric Reform contributed significantly to a number of discourses surrounding the Y2K time-bomb By the late 1980s Crabbe Holdings was almost entirely dedicated to ocean-floor activities especially work on Bubble Pod One BP-1 a deep-submersion habitat aquaculture production and research station whose economic rationale is still not fully understood Unconfirmed reports suggest that by 1990 Crabbe himself had become a permanent resident of BP-1 even though he was by this time suffering from a very serious medical condition of an unspecified radically unprecedented nature By the late 1990s many assumed Crabbe was dead with some even doubting whether he had ever existed However on the night of July 13th 1997 an Indonesian coast-guard radio-monitoring post picked up a mysterious transmission consisting of barely comprehensible subhuman mutterings and croaks Attempts to locate the exact origins of this signal were unsuccessful but the most plausiable estimates place it in the depths of the Java Trench reputed site of Max Crabbe's BP1 Aquapolis The content of this message has never been publicly released but international security and health officials have described it as profoundly disturbing Postscript In March 2003 freelance reporter Iris Carver conducted an in-depth interview with one-time Crabbe-associate and AOE-informant Dr Oskar Sarkon then working as a semi-mechanical croupier at Wendigo's Decadence Den During this conversation Sarkon relayed his own understanding of Crabbe's last days On the night of December 31 1999 Crabbe attended a millennial ritual held in London under the auspices of the AOE by way of a carrier or meta-puppet bearing him as a parasitic intelligence This drastic measure was necessary because at this time Crabbe's own body was distributed between 72 cybernetically-regulated bio-hazard pressure vats scattered throughout BP-1 His meta-amoebic regression had reached such a nadir of disorganization that the only motive power remaining to him was slow sloshing For reasons that remain obscure it had been considered essential that Crabbe attend this ritual conducted by consumate AOE-insider Sir Christopher Stephens now Lord finsbury In order to do so he had participated in an elaborate bodyswapping experiment with chosen vessel captured Hyper C aquassassin Cargo 27 Sarkon seemed unable or unwilling to comment further on the purpose or outcome of this extraordinary and almost certainly illegal event but he left little doubt that the result was far from satisfactory for Crabbe at least from a mammalian standpoint since another entity seems to have repossessed the Cargo 27 meat-puppet casting Crabbe back into his tanks of slithering fish slime with time only to bubble one last cryptic utterance No more life The Tale of the Frog-People Very long ago which some say is also soon Bubbamu set out on a journey in search of the first frog-people She travelled so far back into the past that even Lemuria had not arisen but still the frog-people were already there croaking and laughing Even though she was very tired and seemed to be growing so young that she could scarcely hop she carried on with her journey Eventually she ran out of land entirely and began to swim This was lucky for her because her own legs had completely shrunk away and only her tail remained Despite how far back she had come the frog-people still greeted her laughing more than before which was really later or so it seemed to her then She became so perplexed by the age of the frog-people that she called out to them Tell me why are you here already in this endless sea with no land to hop on or air to croak with it makes no sense to me at all The frog-people continued to laugh and pointed into the distance where a figure was approaching from the other side It was Bubbamu herself grown astonishingly old carrying as many frog-people as she could bear What a childish trick to play on myself she thought I must have travelled around the whole of time the other way bringing the frog people with me Why don't I ever learn Bubbamu was so old by then and also so young that she died and was unborn at the same time and for a moment there were only the frog-people At least that is what the frog-people have always said";
