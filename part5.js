interview with Professor D C Barker Daniel Charles Barker has been Professor of Anorganic Semiotics at Kingsport College MVU Mass since 1992 His extraordinary intellectual achievements resist easy summarization involving profound and polymathic engagement across the entire range of life and earth sciences in addition to archaeocultural research mathematical semiotics anatomical linguistics and informatic engineering Trained as a cryptographer in the early 1970s he has spent his life decoding ancient scripts quasibiotic residues and anomalous mineral patterns amongst other things In late Autumn 1998 Ccru met with Professor Barker in his office at MVU The following is an edited transcript of that meeting Tic-Systems Cryptography has been my guiding thread right through What is geotraumatics about even now A rigorous practice of decoding So I haven't really shifted at all in this respect There is a voyage but a strangely immobile one I started out at MIT working in the information sciences my thesis proposal was quite conservative involving mostly technical issues to do with noise reduction and signal modulation but MVU was just getting started and my research was transferred across to them That led to various contacts and from there to employment with a NASA-related organization that has particular interests connected to SETI activity My task was to help toughen-up the theoretical basis of their signals analysis They wanted to know how to discriminate in principle between intelligent communication and complex pattern derived from nonintelligent sources To cut a long story short it became increasingly obvious to me that although they said they were hunting for intelligence what they were really seeking was organization The whole program was fundamentally misguided Various people had big problems with the direction of my research which had basically veered-off the organizational model The social friction became intolerable and I had to leave which was messy because of my high-level security clearance Suborganizational pattern is where things really happen When you strip-out all the sedimented redundancy from the side of the investigation itself the assumption of intentionality subjectivity interpretability structure etc what remains are assemblies of functionally interconnected microstimulus or tic-systems coincidental information deposits seismocryptions suborganic quasireplicators bacterial circuitries polypoid diagonalizations interphase R-Virus Echo-DNA ionizing nanopopulations plus the macromachineries of their suppression or depotentiation Prevailing signaletics and information-science are both insufficiently abstract and over-theoretical in this regard They cannot see the machine for the apparatus or the singularity for the model So tic-systems require an approach that is cosmicabstract hypermaterialist and also participative methods that do not interpret assemblies as concretizations of prior theories and immanent models that transmute themselves at the level of the signals they process Tic-systems are entirely intractable to subject-object segregation or to rigid disciplinary typologies There is no order of nature no epistemology or scientific metaposition and no unique level of intelligence To advance in this area which is the cosmos requires new cultures or what amounts to the same new machines The problem was how to quantify disorganized multiplicities Diagonal irregular molecular and nonmetric quantities require a scale that is itself nonmetric that escapes overcoding Standard procedures of measurement and classification prove entirely inadequate since they presuppose rigid conceptual segmentation by quantity and quality Deleuze-Guattari's twin-pincers of molarity type and degree Once things are being worked out at the level of tic-assemblies or flat ticking arrays there are only intensive populations and measurement has to give way to engineering fusional multiplicities systems that count themselves only in the way they propagate immanently numbering multitudes like nanoplastic quantum swirls Eventually a machinic solution was provided by the Tick-Distributor but that came later At first there was just the equation precipitated in what I still thought to be my own body virtual tic-density geotraumatic tension Geotraumatics I came to Freud relatively late associating it with Oedipal reductionism and more generally with a psychologistic stance that was simply irrelevant to cryptographic work It's important to remark here no doubt we'll get back to this that everything productive in signals analysis stems from stripping out superfluous prejudices about the source and meaning of complex functional patterns I took and still take the vigorous repudiation of hermeneutics to be the key to theoretical advance in processing sign-systems It was Echidna Stillwell who helped me to see Freud from the other side It was a difficult period for me There had been a lot of painful fall-out from the Nasa work Psychotherapists were involved in part attempting to pathologize and discredit my research and in part responding to real stress-related symptoms Between the two was a grey zone of traumatic dysfunction and paranoia involving difficult feedback effects Stillwell persuaded me that the only way to get through this was to try and make sense of it and that this was not the same as submitting to the interpretative mode On the contrary In Beyond the Pleasure Principle Freud takes a number of crucial initial steps towards mapping the Geocosmic Unconscious as a traumatic megasystem with life and thought dynamically quantized in terms of anorganic tension elasticity or machinic plexion This requires the anorganizational-materialist retuning of an entire vocabulary trauma unconscious drive association screen memory condensation regression displacement complex repression disavowal eg the un prefix identity and person Deleuze and Guattari ask Who does the Earth think it is It's a matter of consistency Start with the scientific story which goes like this between four point five and four billion years ago during the Hadean epoch the earth was kept in a state of superheated molten slag through the conversion of planetesimal and meteoritic impacts into temperature increase kinetic to thermic energy As the solarsystem condensed the rate and magnitude of collisions steadily declined and the terrestrial surface cooled due to the radiation of heat into space reinforced by the beginnings of the hydrocycle During the ensuing Archaen epoch the molten core was buried within a crustal shell producing an insulated reservoir of primal exogeneous trauma the geocosmic motor of terrestrial transmutation And that's it That's plutonics or neoplutonism It's all there anorganic memory plutonic looping of external collisions into interior content impersonal trauma as drivemechanism The descent into the body of the earth corresponds to a regression through geocosmic time Trauma is a body Ultimately at its pole of maximum disequilibrium it's an iron thing At MVU they call it Cthelll the interior third of terrestrial mass semifluid metallic ocean megamolecule and pressure-cooker beyond imagination It's hotter than the surface off the sun down there three thousand clicks below the crust and all that thermic energy is sheer impersonal nonsubjective memory of the outside running the plate-tectonic machinery of the planet via the conductive and convective dynamics of silicate magma flux bathing the whole system in electomagnetic fields as it tidally pulses to the orbit of the moon Cthelll is the terrestrial inner nightmare nocturnal ocean Xanadu the anorganic metal-body trauma-howl of the earth cross-hatched by intensities traversed by thermic waves and currents deranged particles ionic strippings and gluttings gravitational deep-sensitivities transduced into nonlocal electromesh and feeding vulcanism that's why plutonic science slides continuously into schizophrenic delirium Fast forward seismology and you hear the earth scream Geotrauma is an ongoing process whose tension is continually expressed partially frozen in biological organization For instance the peculiarly locked-up lifeforms we tend to see as typical those more-or-less obedient to Darwinian selection mechanics are less than six hundred million years old They began with the planetary oxygenization crisis triggered by the saturation of crustal iron followed by mass oxygen-poisoning of the prokaryotic biosystem and the emergence of a eukaryotic regime Eukaryotic cells are highly suppressive They implement a nuclear command-control model based on genomic ROM affined to meiosis-mitosis diplocapture hierarchical organization and multicellular specialization Even the distinction between ontogeny and phylogeny distinct time-orders of the individual and the species makes little sense without eukaryotic nuclear read-only programming and immunological identity Evolutionism presupposes specific geotraumatic outcomes To take a more recent example the eﬄorescence of mammalian life occurs in the wake of the K-T-Missile which combined with massive magma-plume activity in the Indian Ocean to shut-down the Mesozoic Era sixty-five million years ago Irruptive vulcanism plus extraterrestrial impact linked by coincidence or plutonic looping So there is a catastrophic transition to a post-saurian megafauna regime part of a much larger overall reorganization of terrestrial symptomaticity providing an index of neohadean resurgence And what is mammalian life relative to the great saurians Above all an innovation in mothering Suckling as biosurvivalism Tell me about your mother and you're travelling back to K-T not into the personal unconscious Spinal-Catastrophism For humans there is the particular crisis of bipedal erect posture to be processed I was increasingly aware that all my real problems were modalities of back-pain or phylogenetic spinal injury which took me back to the calamitous consequences of the precambrian explosion roughly five hundred million years ago The ensuing period is incrementally body-mapped by metazoan organization Obviously there are discrete quasi-coherent neuromotor tic-flux patterns whose incrementally rigidified stages are swimming crawling and bipedal walking Elaine Morgan persuasively traces the origin of protohuman bipedalism to certain deleterious plate-tectonic shifts The model is bioseismic Crustal convulsions and animal body-plan are rigorously interconnected and the entire Aquatic Ape Theory constitutes an exemplary geotraumatic analysis Erect posture and perpendicularization of the skull is a frozen calamity associated with a long list of pathological consequences amongst which should be included most of the human psychoneuroses Numerous trends in contemporary culture attest to an attempted recovery of the icthyophidian or flexomotile-spine horizontal and impulsive rather than vertical and stress-bearing The issue here as always is real and effective regression It is not a matter of representational psychology Consider Haeckel's widely discredited Recapitulation Thesis the claim that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny It is a theory compromised by its organicism but its wholesale rejection was an overreaction Ballard's response is more productive and balanced treating DNA as a transorganic memory-bank and the spine as a fossil record without rigid onto-phylogenic correspondence The mapping of spinal-levels onto neuronic time is supple episodic and diagonalizing It concerns plexion between blocks of machinic transition not strict isomorphic or stratic redundancy between scales of chronological order Mammal DNA contains latent fish-code amongst many other things Palate-Tectonics Due to erect posture the head has been twisted around shattering vertebro-perceptual linearity and setting-up the phylogenetic preconditions for the face This right-angled pneumatic-oral arrangement produces the vocal-apparatus as a crash-site in which thoracic impulses collide with the roof of the mouth The bipedal head becomes a virtual speech-impediment a sub-cranial pneumatic pile-up discharged as linguo-gestural development and cephalization take-off Burroughs suggests that the protohuman ape was dragged through its body to expire upon its tongue Its a twin-axial system howls and clicks reciprocally articulated as a vowel-consonant phonetic palette rigidly intersegmented to repress staccatohiss continuous variation and its attendant becomings-animal That's why stammerings stutterings vocal tics extralingual phonetics and electrodigital voice synthesis are so laden with biopolitical intensity they threaten to bypass the anthropostructural head-smash that establishes our identity with logos escaping in the direction of numbers Barker Numbering Once numbers are no longer overcoded and thus released from their metric function they are freed for other things and tend to become diagrammatic From the beginning of my tic-systems work the most consistent problems have concerned intensive sequences Sequence is not order Order already supposes a doubling a level of redundancy the sequenced sequence A decoded sequence is something else a sheer numeracy prior to any insertion into chronologic structure That's why decoding number implies an escape from assumptions of progressive time Tick multitudes arrive in convergent waves without subordination to chronology history or linear causation They proceed by infolding involution or implex It's a matter of convergence and numbers do that once they're free to So the first stage required plexive introgression of the tic-density scale which was numerically rigorized as digital twinning Treat the decimal numerals as a set of 9-sum twins zygonovize and they map an abstract intensive wave indifferent to magnitude Everything efficient about digital reduction is concerned with this since it discovers the key to decimal syzygetic complementarity 9 0 A flattening down to disordered sequentiality or abstract numerical implex Nine is the ultimate decimal numeral operating as positive or full-body zero It is the abstract numeric product of the decimal-magnitude minus one infinitesimalized as 1 0999 reiterating which relates to a particular mode of proliferation within capitalist semiotics of the type $9999 Barker-Spiral The pattern really came together with the Diplozygotic Spiral which arrived suddenly by chance I was playing a game of Decadence which I had first encountered many years before This game already interested me because of its numerical elegance its complex associations and its dependence upon a principle of decimal twinning It had always seemed to hint at a lost syzygetic arithmetism related to the bilateral symmetry of the human body Digits are fingers and they come in decimal packages of two times five In Decadence five makes ten by doubling or pairing with itself scoring zero This tantalized me but I couldn't fit it together theoretically The quandary was unlocked on this occasion when one of the participants casually mentioned the existence of an occulted variation of the game called Subdecadence based on a system of nine-sum twinning Subdecadence introduces zeroes and nine-zero twins It works by zygonovic numerism That was stunning enough in itself but seeing the two together or seeing between them was an incredible moment of diagrammatic assemblage It all spontaneously condensed and the Spiral clicked into coherence like a secret door into the long-hidden crypt of the decimal system

Kingsport College Press 1997 Kuttadid Professor Barker told us that during the early 70s he was engaged in SETI-related research based at a high-security signal-monitoring station in the South-Pacific One day he was walking in the hills where he met an old Dibboma woman selling tribal carvings by the road Most of her wares were marriage amulets depicting the demon Kuttadid in the guise of a giant sumatran cockroach with intricate antennae and bearing the larvae of a parasitic wasp When he asked her what was special about Kuttadid she didn't seem to understand So he asked what Kuttadid was the demon of Laughing she replied Kuttaida And what are Kuttaida he continued Oh she answered they are things that click or chirp which seem to be demons but are not We never believe anything Kuttadid tells us She is a most wicked and dishonest demon Besides our disbelief is the way that she hides My Dibbomese was never very proficient Barker warned us Maybe I misunderstood what she was saying A telegraphist employed by the Dutch colonial administration notes Amongst no other native population have I found such natural delight in technical contrivancesWhenever a message was received the locals would gather around the counter and peek in as if entranced by the automatic tapping The children in particular exhibited an insatiable curiosity Many times I was besieged with detailed questions about the mechanical principles of the apparatus frequently challenging the limits of my own comprehension For months this baﬄed me entirely until at the end of one particularly minute explanation a Dibbo youth cried out joyfully Aha There is no demon It is another trick of Kuttadid and now we see how it is done Dibboma Kuttadid-cults consider the cockroach a sacred animal and say that it only seems to be alive It is invested by Kuttaida a word which Stillwell translates as pseudovital animation or fake-life She tells of how in the Dibboma areas of Eastern Sumatra cockroaches are often found nailed to door-posts still twitching clicking and trying to crawl where they are impaled to divert the evil waspdemon Tching Occasions of Western squeamishness meets with laughter See how it seems to suffer as if attempting endlessly to escape but that is just Kuttadid trickery Kuttaida The Tale of Cockroach There was a time when Katak and Oddubb decided to play a trick on Murrumur Let us make a solar-gadget that she will think is alive they said She knows nothing of the sun so we can work in secrecy Soon afterwards when Oddubb was on her way to Katak to carry out their plan Cockroach which was already many fell out of the sun and ran past exactly as if it was alive Oddubb was amazed and a little irritated When she reached Katak's lair she couldn't help croaking sadly You made cockroach without me I thought we were to do it together but it scampered past just now You must have started early because it was already very numerous Katak was at first perplexed and then extremely angry I didn't make cockroach she raged I have been waiting for you here Somehow we have been tricked To this day no one knows where cockroach came from except maybe Murrumur who has never said anything about it Since then Kuttadid has existed too although some say that she existed secretly before and others say that she has only ever pretended to exist"
