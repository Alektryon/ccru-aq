cthulhu = "Part-2 The Cthulhu Club Genesis of neolemurianism Lemurian Time War The account that follows charts William Burroughs involvement in an occult time war and considerably exceeds most accepted conceptions of social and historical probability It is based on sensitive information passed to the Ccru by an intelligence source whom we have called William Kaye The narrative has been partially fictionalized in order to protect this individual's identity Kaye himself admitted that his experiences had made him prone to paranoidchronomaniac hallucination and Ccru continues to find much of his tale extremely implausible Nevertheless whilst suspecting that his message had been severely compromised by dubious inferences noise and disinformation we have become increasingly convinced that he was indeed an insider of some kind even if the organization he had penetrated was itself an elaborate hoax or collective delusion Kaye referred to this organization as The Order or following Burroughs The Board' When reduced to its basic provocation Kaye's claim was this The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar which he also referred to as the Burroughs Necronomicon a text dating from 1987 had been an exact and decisive influence on the magical and military career of one Captain Mission three centuries previously Mission appears in historical record as a notorious pirate active in the period around 1700 AD he was to become renowned as the founder of the anarchistic colony of Libertatia established on the island of Madagascar Kaye asserted that he had personally encountered clear evidence of Burroughs impact upon Mission at the private library of Peter Vysparov where Kaye worked most of his life The Vysparov collection he unswervingly maintained held an ancient illustrated transcript of The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar inscribed meticulously in Mission's own hand Kaye assured us that the Board considered the demonstrable time rift he was describing to be a matter of the gravest concern He explained that the organization had been born in reaction to a nightmare of time coming apart and to use his exact words spiraling out of control To the Board spirals were particularly repugnant symbols of imperfection and volatility Unlike closed loops spirals always have loose ends This allows them to spread making them contagious and unpredictable The Board was counting on Kaye to contain the situation He was assigned the task of terminating the spiral templex Hyperstition Vysparov had sought out Burroughs because of his evident interest in the convergence of sorcery dreams and fiction In the immediate postwar years Vysparov had convened the so-called Cthulhu Club to investigate connections between the fiction of H P Lovecraft mythology science and magic and was at stage in the process of formalizing the constitution of Miskatonic Virtual University MVU a loose aggregation of non-standard theorists whose work could broadly be said to have Lovecraftian connotations The interest in Lovecraft's fiction was motivated by its exemplification of the practice of hyperstition a concept had been elaborated and keenly debated since the inception of the Cthulhu Club Loosely defined the coinage refers to fictions that make themselves real' Kaye drew Ccru's attention to Burroughs's description of viruses in Ah Pook is Here 'And what is a virus Perhaps simply a pictorial series like Egyptian glyphs that makes itself real AP 102 The papers Kaye left for Ccru included a copy of this page of the Ah Pook text with these two sentences italicized in the original text heavily underlined For Kaye the echo of Vysparov's language was unequivocal evidence of the Russian's influence upon Burroughs's work after 1958 Whether or not this is the case such passages indicate that Burroughs like Vysparov was interested in the hyperstitional relations between writing signs and reality In the hyperstitional model Kaye outlined fiction is not opposed to the real Rather reality is understood to be composed of fictions consistent semiotic terrains that condition perceptual affective and behaviorial responses Kaye considered Burroughs work to be exemplary of hyperstitional practice Burroughs construed writing and art in general not aesthetically but functionally that is to say magically with magic defined as the use of signs to produce changes in reality Kaye maintained that it was far from accidental that Burroughs's equation of reality and fiction had been most widely embraced only in its negative aspect as a variety of postmodern ontological skepticism rather than in its positive sense as an investigation into the magical powers of incantation and manifestation the efficacy of the virtual For Kaye the assimilation of Burroughs into textualist postmodernism constituted a deliberate act of interpretevist sabotage the aim of which was to de-functionalise Burroughs's writings by converting them into aesthetic exercises in style Far from constituting a subversion of representative realism the postmodern celebration of the text without a referent merely consummates a process that representative realism had initiated Representative realism severs writing from any active function surrendering it to the role of reflecting not intervening in the world It is a short step to a dimension of pristine textuality in which the existence of a world independent of discourse is denied altogether According to Kaye the metaphysics of Burroughs's clearly hyperstitional fictions can be starkly contrasted with those at work in postmodernism For postmodernists the distinction between real and unreal is not substantive or is held not to matter whereas for practitioners of hyperstition differentiating between degrees of realization is crucial The hyperstitional process of entities making themselves real is precisely a passage a transformation in which potentials already-active virtualities realize themselves Writing operates not as a passive representation but as an active agent of transformation and a gateway through which entities can emerge By writing a universe the writer makes such a universe possible WV 321 But these operations do not occur in neutral territory Kaye was quick to point out Burroughs treats all conditions of existence as results of cosmic conflicts between competing intelligence agencies In making themselves real entities must also manufacture realities for themselves realities whose potency often depends upon the stupefaction subjugation and enslavement of populations and whose existence is in conflict with other reality programs Burroughs's fiction deliberately renounces the status of plausible representation in order to operate directly upon this plane of magical war Where realism merely reproduces the currently dominant reality program from inside never identifying the existence of the program as such Burroughs seeks to get outside the control codes in order to dismantle and rearrange them Every act of writing is a sorcerous operation a partisan action in a war where multitudes of factual events are guided by the powers of illusion WV 253-4 Even representative realism participates albeit unknowingly in magical war collaborating with the dominant control system by implicitly endorsing its claim to be the only possible reality From the controllers point of view Kaye said it is of course imperative that Burroughs is thought of as merely a writer of fiction That's why they have gone to such lengths to sideline him into a ghetto of literary experimentation' The One God Universe Burroughs names the dominant control program One God Universe or OGU He wages war against the fiction of OGU which builds its monopolistic dominion upon the magical power of the Word upon programming and illusion OGU establishes a fiction which operates at the most fatal level of reality where questions of biological destiny and immortality are decided Religions are weapons WL 202 In order to operate effectively OGU must first of all deny the existence of magical war itself There is only one reality its own In writing about magical war Burroughs is thus already initiating an act of war against OGU mainlining contestation into primal unity OGU incorporates all competing fictions into its own story the ultimate metanarrative reducing alternative reality systems to negatively-marked components of its own mythos other reality programs become Evil associated with the powers of deception and delusion OGU's power works through fictions that repudiate their own fictional status antifictions and unnonfictions And that' Kaye said is why fiction can be a weapon in the struggle against Control' In OGU fiction is safely contained by a metaphysical frame prophylactically delimiting all contact between the fiction and what is outside it The magical function of words and signs is both condemned as evil and declared to be delusory facilitating a monopoly upon the magical power of language for OGU which of course denies that its own mythos exerts any magical influence presenting it as a simple representation of Truth But OGU's confidence that fiction has safely been contained means that anti-OGU agents can use fiction as a covert line of communication and a secret weapon he concealed and revealed the knowledge in fictional form WV 455 This for Kaye was a formula for hyperstitional practice Diagrams maps sets of abstract relations tactical gambits are as real in a fiction about a fiction about a fiction as they are encountered raw but subjecting such semiotic contraband to multiple embeddings allows a traffic in materials for decoding dominant reality that would otherwise be proscribed Rather than acting as transcendental screens blocking out contact between itself and the world the fiction acts as a Chinese box a container for sorcerous interventions in the world The frame is both used for concealment and broken the fictions potentiate changes in reality Whereas hyperstitional agitation produces a positive unbelief a provisionalizing of any reality frame in the name of pragmatic engagement rather than epistemological hesitation OGU feeds on belief In order to work the story that runs reality has to be believed which is also to say that the existence of a control program determining reality must not be suspected or believed Credulity in the face of the OGU meta-narrative is inevitably coupled with a refusal to accept that entities like Control have any substantive existence That's why to get out of OGU a systematic shedding of all beliefs is a prerequisite Only those who can leave behind everything they have ever believed in can hope to escape WL 116 Techniques of escape depend on attaining the unbelief of assassin-magician Hassan i Sabbah nothing is true everything is permitted Once again Kaye cautioned that this must be carefully distinguished from postmodern relativism Burroughs-Sabbah's nothing is true cannot be equated with postmodernism's nothing is real On the contrary nothing is true because there is no single authorized version of reality instead there is a superfluity an excess of realities The Adversary's game plan is to persuade you that he does not exist WL 12 The Episode Kaye's story began in the summer of 1958 when his employer Peter Vysparov met William Burroughs whilst conducting occult investigations in Paris As a result of this meeting Kaye was himself introduced to Burroughs on December 23rd of the same year at Vysparov's private library in New York It is clear from public documentary material that Burroughs was predominantly resident in Paris and London at this time Ccru found no evidence of any trip to the USA although his biography is not sufficiently comprehensive to rule out an excursion to NY with confidence There is no doubt however that shortly after the winter of 1958 Burroughs starts writing cryptically of visions paranormal phenomena encountering his double and working with cut up techniques As Burroughs hunted through the library's unparalleled collection of rare occult works he made a discovery that involved him in a radical apparently unintelligible disorder of time and identity The trigger was his encounter with a text that he was yet to compose an old picture book with gilt edged lithographs onion paper over each picture The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar in gold scrip GLM 30 He could not then have known that Captain Mission had taken the very same volume as his guide three centuries previously already describing it as old' flipping through the pages Burroughs entered a momentary catatonic trance state He emerged disoriented and scarcely able to stand Despite his confusion he was more than willing to describe with a strange sardonic detachment the anomalous episode Twenty-nine years would pass before Kaye understood what had occurred Burroughs told Kaye that during the trance it felt as though silent communication with a ghostly non-human companion had flashed him forward to his life as an old man several decades in the future Oppressed by a crushing sensation of implacable destiny as if fragments of a frozen time dimension were cascading into awareness he remembered writing The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar although it wasn't writing exactly and his writing implements were archaic belonging to someone else entirely in another place and time Even after his recovery the sense of oppression persisted like a new dimension of gravity The vision had granted him horrific insight into the jail-house mind of the One God He was convinced the knowledge was dangerous and that powerful forces were conspiring against him that the invisible brothers are invading present time WV 220 The episode sharpened his already vivid impression that the human animal is cruelly caged in time by an alien power Recalling it later he would write Time is a human aﬄiction not a human invention but a prison GC 16-17 Although there is no direct historical evidence supporting Kaye's description of events the immediate period after the 1958 episode provides compelling symptomatic evidence of a transformation in Burroughs's strategies and preoccupations during this period It was then that Burroughs's writing underwent a radical shift in direction with the introduction of experimental techniques whose sole purpose was to escape the bonds of the already-written charting a flight from destiny Gysin's role in the discovery of these cut-ups and fold ins is well-known but Kaye's story accounts for the special urgency with which Burroughs began deploying these new methods in late 1958 The cut-ups and fold-ins were innovative timewar tactics the function of which was to subvert the foundations of the prerecorded universe10 Cut the Word Lines with scissors or switchblades as preferred The Word Lines keep you in time WV 270 Burroughs's adoption of these techniques was Kaye told Ccru one of the first effects if one may be permitted to speak in so loose a way of the time-trauma Naturally Kaye attributes Burroughs's intense antipathy towards prerecording a persistent theme in his fiction after The Naked Lunch to his experiences in the Vysparov library The cosmic revelation in the library produced in Burroughs a horror so profound that he would dedicate the rest of his life to plotting and propagating escape routes from the board rooms and torture banks of time NE 33 Much later Burroughs would describe a crushing feeling of inevitability of life being scripted in advance by malign entities the custodians of the future convene Keepers of the Board Books Mektoub it is written And they don't want it changed GC 8 It was in the immediate aftermath of the episode in the Vysparov library that Burroughs exhibited the first signs of an apparently random attachment to lemurs the decisive implications of which took several decades to surface Burroughs was unsure who was running him like a spy in somebody else's body where nobody knows who is spying on whom WV xxviii Until the end of his life he struggled against the Thing inside him The Ugly Spirit GC 48 remarking that 'I live with the constant threat of possession and a constant need to escape from possession from Control WV 94 Escaping Control In Burroughs mythology OGU emerges once MU the Magical Universe is violently overthrown by the forces of monopoly WL 113 The Magical Universe is populated by many gods eternally in conflict there is no possibility of unitary Truth since the nature of reality is constantly contested by heterogeneous entities whose interests are radically incommensurable Where monotheistic fiction tells of a rebellious secession from the primordial One Burroughs describes the One initiating a war against the Many These were troubled times There was war in the heavens as the One God attempted to exterminate or neutralize the Many Gods and establish an absolute seat of power The priests were aligning themselves on one side or the other Revolution was spreading up from the South moving from the East and from the Western deserts WL 101 OGU is antimagical authoritarian dogmatic the deadly enemy of those who are committed to the magical universe spontaneous unpredictable alive The universe they are imposing is controlled predictable dead WL 59 Such a universe gives rise to the dreary paradoxes so familiar to monotheistic theology that necessarily attend omnipotence and omniscience 'Consider the One God Universe OGU The spirit recoils in horror from such a deadly impasse He is all-powerful and all-knowing Because He can do everything He can do nothing since the act of doing demands opposition He knows everything so there is nothing for him to learn He can't go anywhere since He is already fucking everywhere like cowshit in Calcutta The OGU is a prerecorded universe in which He is the recorder WL 113 For Kaye the superiority of Burroughs's analysis of power over trivial ideology critique consists in its repeated emphasis on the relationship between control systems and temporality Burroughs is emphatic obsessive In Time any being that is spontaneous and alive will wither and die like an old joke WL 111 A basic impasse of all control machines is this Control needs time in which to exercise control WV 339 OGU control codings far exceed ideological manipulation amounting to cosmic reality programming because at the limit the One God is Time' WL 111 The presumption of chronological time is written into the organism at the most basic level scripted into its unconsciously performed habituated behaviors Time is that which ends Time is limited time experienced by a sentient creature Sentient of time that is making adjustments to time in terms of what Korzybski calls neuro-muscular intention behaviour with respect to the environment as a whole A plant turns towards the sun nocturnal animal stirs at sun set shit piss move eat fuck die Why does Control need humans Control needs time Control needs human time Control needs your shit piss pain orgasm death AP 17 Power operates most effectively not by persuading the conscious mind but by delimiting in advance what it is possible to experience By formatting the most basic biological processes of the organism in terms of temporality Control ensures that all human experience is of and in time That is why time is a prison for humans 'Man was born in time He lives and dies in time Wherever he goes he takes time with him and imposes time GC 17 Korzybski's definition of man as the time-binding animal has a double sense for Burroughs On the one hand human beings are binding time for themselves they 'can make information available over any length of time to other men through writing GC 66 On the other hand humans are binding themselves into time building more of the prison which constrains their affects and perceptions Korzybski's words took on a horrible new meaning for Burroughs in the library Kaye said he saw what time-binding really was all the books already written time bound forever' Since writing customarily operates as the principal means of time-binding Burroughs reasoned that innovating new writing techniques would unbind time blowing a hole in the OGU pre-sent and opening up Space Cut the Word Lines with scissors or switchblades as preferred The Word Lines keep you in time Cut the in lines Make out lines to Space WV 270 Space has to be understood not as empirical extension still less as a transcendental given but in the most abstract sense as the zone of unbound potentialities lying beyond the purview of the OGU's already-written 'You can see that Burroughs's writing involves the highest possible stakes Kaye wrote It does not represent cosmic war it is already a weapon in that war It is not surprising that the forces ranged against him the many forces ranged against him you can't overestimate their influence on this planet sought to neutralize that weapon It was a matter of the gravest urgency that his works be classified as fantasies experimental dada anything but that they should be recognized as what they are technologies for altering reality' The Rift For almost thirty years Burroughs had sought to evade the inevitable Yet numerous signs indicate that by the late 1980s the Control Complex was breaking down redirecting Burroughs's flight from prerecorded destiny into a gulf of unsettled fate that he came to call the Rift' Kaye consistently maintained than any attempt to date Burroughs's encounter with the Rift involved a fundamental misconception Nevertheless his own account of this episode repeatedly stressed the importance of the year 1987 a date that marked a period of radical transition the eye of a spiral templex It was during this time that the obscure trauma at the Vysparov library flooded back with full force saturating Burroughs's dreams and writings with visions of lemurs ghosts from the Land of the Dead 1987 was the year in which Burroughs visited the Duke University Lemur Conservation Center consolidating an alliance with the non-anthropoid primates or prosimians11 In The Western Lands which Burroughs was writing during this year he remarks that At sight of the Black Lemur with round red eyes and a little red tongue protruding the writer experiences a delight that is almost painful WL 248 Most crucially it was in 1987 that Omni magazine commissioned and published Burroughs short story The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar a text that propelled his entire existence into the Rift of Lemurian Time Wars For some time previously Kaye's suspicions had been aroused by Burroughs's increasingly obsessional attitude to his cats His devotion to Calico fletch Ruski and Spooner12 exhibited a profound biological response that was the exact inversion of his instinctual revulsion for centipedes His libidinal conversion to a cat man WV 506 also tracked and influenced an ever deepening disillusionment with the function of human sexuality orgasm addiction and Venusian conspiracy 'Cats may be my last living link to a dying species WV 506 Burroughs wrote in his essay The Cat Inside For Kaye it was evident that this intensifying attachment to domestic felines was part of a more basic current typified by an intimate familiarization with the cat spirit or creature who partakes of many other species including raccoons ferrets skunks CRN 244 and numerous varieties of lemurs such as ring-tailed cat lemurs GC 3 the sifaka lemur mouse lemur GC 4 and ultimately the gentle deer lemur GC 18 As initiatory beings mediumistic familiars or occult door-keepers these animals returned Burroughs to lost Lemurian landscapes and to his double Captain Mission Kaye was highly dismissive of all critical accounts that treated Mission as a literary avatar as if Burroughs was basically an experimental novelist He maintained that the relation between Burroughs and Mission was not that of author to character but rather that of anachronistic contemporaries 13 bound together in a knot of definite yet cognitively distressing facts Of these facts none was more repugnant to common human rationality than their mutual involvement with The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar 'We offer refuge to all people everywhere who suffer under the tyranny of governments CRN 265 declared Mission14 This statement was sufficient to awaken the hostile interest of the Powers That Be although from the Board's perspective even Mission's piratical career was a relatively trivial transgression Their primary concern was a more significant danger Captain Mission's unwholesome concern with lemurs GLM 28 'Mission was spending more and more time in the jungle with his lemurs GC 11 the ghosts of a lost continent slipping into time disturbances and spiral patterns Lemurs became his sleeping and dream companions He discovered through this dead and dying species that the key to escaping control is taking the initiative or the pre-initiative by interlinking with the Old Ones 'The Lemur people are older than Homo Sap much older They date back one hundred sixty million years to the time when Madagascar split off from the mainland of Africa They might be called psychic amphibians that is visible only for short periods when they assume a solid form to breathe but some of them can remain in the invisible state for years at a time Their way of thinking and feeling is basically different from ours not oriented toward time and sequence and causality They find these concepts repugnant and difficult to understand GLM 31 The Board conceived Mission's traffic with lemurs his experiments in time sorcery and his anachronistic entanglement with Burroughs as a single intolerable threat 'In a prerecorded and therefore totally predictable universe the blackest sin is to tamper with the prerecording which could result in altering the prerecorded future Captain Mission was guilty of this sin GLM 27 'Now more lemurs appear as in a puzzle GC 15 Lemurs are denizens of the Western Lands the great red island GC 116 of Madagascar which Mission knew as Western Lemuria15 The Land of The Lemur People NE 98 a Wild West It was on the island of Madagascar that Captain Mission discovered the word for lemur' meant ghost in the native language GC 2 just as the ancient Romans spoke of lemures wraiths or shades of the dead16 In their joint voyage across the ghost continent of Lemuria interlinked by lemurs Mission and Burroughs find immortality through involvement with the native populations of unlife In describing this process Kaye placed particular emphasis on Burroughs 1987 visit to the Duke University Lemur Center It was this colony of lemurs that introduced Burroughs to the West Lemurian time pocket GC 15 just as Captain Mission was drifting out faster and faster caught in a vast undertow of time Out and under and out and out a voice repeated in his head GC 17 If time-travel ever happens it always does He finds himself at the gateway inside the ancient stone structure GLM 28 with the lemur who is his phantom his Ghost GLM 29 seated at a writing table with inkpot quill pens parchment GLM 29 He uses a native drug to explore the gateway Who built it When The tale comes to him in a time-faulted vision transmitted in hieroglyphics He chooses a quill pen GLM 29 It is difficult to describe where the text comes from but there it is an old illustrated book with gilt edges The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar GLM 29 an old picture book with gilt edged lithographs onion paper over each picture The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar in gold script GLM 30 The vision echoes or overlaps timetwinning waves where Mission and Burroughs coincide They copy an invocation or summoning a joint templex innovation that predates the split between creation and recording reaching back before the appearance of man on earth before the beginning of time GC 15 'When attached to Africa Madagascar was the ultimate landmass sticking out like a disorderly tumor cut by a rift of future contours this long rift like a vast indentation like the cleft that divides the human body GC 16 They feel themselves thrown forward 160 million years as they access the Big Picture a seismic slippage from geological time into transcendental time anomaly The island of Madagascar shears away from the African mainland17 whilst on the other side of time Western Lemuria drifts back up into the present The Lemurian continentity sinks into the distant future stranding the red island with its marooned lemur people What is the meaning of 160 million years without time And what does time mean to foraging lemurs GC 16-17 Time crystallizes as concentric contractions seize the spiral mass From deep in the ages of slow Panic18 they see the People of the Cleft formulated by chaos and accelerated time flash through a hundred sixty million years to the Split Which side are you on Too late to change now Separated by a curtain of fire GLM 31 The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar opens out onto the Rift the split between the wild the timeless the free and the tame the time-bound the tethered GC 13 as one side of the rift drifted into enchanted timeless innocence and the other 'moved inexorably toward language time tool use weapon use war exploitation and slavery GC 49 Which side are you on As time rigidifies The Board closes in on the Lemur people on a chance that has already passed a ghost of chance a chance that is already dead the might-havebeens who had one chance in a billion and lost GC 18 Exterminate the brutes Mission knows that a chance that occurs only once in a hundred and sixty million years has been lost forever GC 21 and Burroughs awakens screaming from dreams of dead lemurs scattered through the settlement GC719 According to Kaye everyone on the inside knew about the bad dreams certain they were coming from a real place In this as so much else Kaye's reconstruction of the 1987 event depended centrally upon The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar an account he cited as if it were a strictly factual record even a sacred text He explained that this interpretative stance had been highly developed by the Board since respecting the reality of non-actualities is essential when waging war in deeply virtualized environments in spaces that teem with influential abstractions and other ghostly things Kaye considered Bradly Martin for instance to be entirely real He described him as an identifiable contemporary individual working as an agent of the Board whose task was to seal the ancient structure that provides access to the Rift The Board had long known that the Vysparov library contained an old copy of The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar which dated itself with the words Now in 1987' GLM 34 It had been catalogued there since 1789 The text was a self-confessed time-abomination requiring radical correction It disregarded fundamental principles of sequence and causality openly aligning itself with the lemur people What the Board needed was a dead end Burroughs was an obvious choice for a number of reasons He was sensitive to transmissions amenable to misogyny and mammal-chauvenism socially marginalized and controllable through junk They were confident Kaye recalled that the forthcoming 1987 story would be lost amongst the self-marginalizing fictions of a crumbling junky fag' On the outside it worked as a cover-up but the Insiders had a still more essential task They had inherited the responsibility for enforcing the Law of Time and of OGU Defend the integrity of the timeline This Great Work involved horrifying compromises Kaye cited the hermetic maxim Strict obedience to the Law excuses grave transgressions They're speaking of White Chronomancy he explained the sealing of runaway time-disturbances within closed loops 20 What Mission had released Burroughs had bound again That is how it seemed to the Board in 1987 with the circle apparently complete Confident that the transcendental closure of time was being achieved the Board appropriated the text as the record of a precognitive intuition a prophecy that could be mined for information It confirmed their primary imperative and basic doctrine foretelling the ultimate triumph of OGU and the total eradication of Lemurian insurgency Mission had understood this well No quarter no compromise is possible This is war to extermination GC 9 It seems never to have occurred to the Board that Burroughs would change the ending that their dead end would open a road to the Western Lands21 Things that should have been long finished continued to stir It was as if a post-mortem coincidence or unlife influence had vortically re-animated itself A strange doubling occurred Burroughs entitled it The Ghost of Chance masking the return of the Old Ones in the seemingly innocuous words People of the world are at last returning to their source in spirit back to the little lemur people GC 54 The Board had no doubt this was a return to the true horror Yet Kaye insisted for those with eyes to see The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar announced its turbular Lemurian destination from the beginning and its final words are lost beneath the waves GLM 34 Kaye's own final words to the Ccru written on a scrap of paper upon which he had scrawled hurriedly in a spiderish hand that already indicated the tide of encroaching insanity remain consistent with this unsatisfactory conclusion Across the time rift termination confuses itself with eddies of a latent spiral current' Notes 1 Ccru first met William Kaye on March 20th 1999 He stated at this our first and last face to face encounter that his purpose in contacting Ccru was to ensure that his tale would be protected against the ravages of time The irony was not immediately apparent 2 We have recorded our comments doubts along with details of his story in the footnotes to this document 3 This story was commissioned and published by Omni Magazine in 1987 The only constraint imposed by the magazine was that there should not be too much sex 4 Kaye was adamant that the existence of these two texts could not be attributed to either coincidence or plagiarism although his reasoning was at times obscure and less than wholly persuasive to the Ccru Nor has Ccru been able to track down examples of Mission's handwriting sufficient to provide a basis for identification of the manuscript although Kaye assured us that the British Museum the Smithsonian Institute and several private collections possessed the relevant documents despite their denials of the fact 5 The concept of the spiral templex according to which the rigorous analysis of all time anomalies excavates a spiral structure is fully detailed in RE Templeton's Miskatonic lectures on transcendental time-travel A brief overview of this material has been published by Ccru as The Templeton Episode in Digital Hyperstition Abstract Culture volume 4 6 Vysparov's involvement in Aleistair Crowley's OTO and Thelemic magick is evident from his treatise on Atlantean Black Magic Kingsport Press 1949 His investigations into the connections between the writings of Crowley and Lovecraft seems to have foreshadowed the similarly oriented researches of Kenneth Grant although there is no reason to believe that Grant was in any way aware of the Cthulhu Club synthesis 7 Kaye insisted on grounds that he refused to divulge that this meeting was not a chance encounter but had in some way been orchestrated by the Order 8 See Burroughs's letters from January 1959 9 Kaye noted that both Vysparov and Burroughs had been mutually forthcoming about their respective experiences of a mystico-transcendental nature Although this openness would seem to run counter to the hermetic spirit of occult science Kaye described it as surprisingly common amongst magicians' 10 Burroughs described his production methods cut-ups and fold-ins as a timetravel technology coded as a passage across decimal magnitudes I take page one and fold it into page one hundred I insert the resulting composite as page ten When the reader reads page ten he is flashing forwards in time to page one hundred and back in time to page one WV 272 11 There are two sub-orders of primates the anthropoids consisting of monkeys apes and humans and the prosimians which include madagascan lemurs asian lorises australian galgoes or bushbabies and the tarsiers of the Philippines and Indonesia The prosimians constitute a branch of evolution distinct from and older than the anthropoids Outside Madagascar competition from the anthropoids has driven all prosimians into a nocturnal mode of existence 12 The extent of Burroughs's attachment to his feline companions is evidenced by his final words as recorded in his diaries Nothing is There is no final enough of wisdom experience any fucking thing No Holy Grail No final Satori no final solution Just conflict Only thing can resolve conflict is love like I felt for fletch and Ruski Spooner and Calico Pure love What I feel for my cats present and past LW 253 13 Ccru was never fully confident as to the exact meaning of this pronouncement Kaye seemed to be suggesting that Mission and Burroughs were the same person caught within the vortex of a mysterious personality interchange that could not be resolved within time 14 Burroughs writes of Madagascar providing a vast sanctuary for the lemurs and for the delicate spirits that breathe through them GC 16 This convergence of ecological and political refuge fascinated Kaye who on several occasions noted that the number for Refuge in Roget's Thesaurus is 666 The relevance of this point still largely escapes the Ccru 15 Puzzling consistencies between rocks fossils and animal species found in South Asia and Eastern Africa led 19th Century palaeontologists and geologists to postulate a lost landmass that once connected the two now separated regions This theory was vigorously supported by E H Haeckel 1834-1919 who used it to explain the distribution of Lemur-related species throughout Southern Africa South and South-East Asia On this basis the English Zoologist Phillip L Sclater 1829-1913 named the hypothetical continent Lemuria or Land of the Lemurs Lemurs are treated as relics or biological remainders of a hypothetical continent living ghosts of a lost world Haeckel's theoretical investment in Lemuria however went much further than this He proposed that the invented continent was the probable cradle of the human race speculating that it provided a solution to the Darwinian mystery of the missing link the absence of immediately pre-human species from the fossil record For Haeckel Lemuria was the original home of man the true Eden all traces of which had been submerged by its disappearance He considered the biological unity of the human species to have since been lost disintegrating into twelve distinct species As a scientific conjecture Lemuria has been buried by scientific progress Not only have palaeontologists largely dispelled the problem of the missing link through additional finds but the science of Plate Tectonics has also replaced the notion of 'sunken continents with that of continental drift Now bypassed by conventional rationality as a scientific fiction or an accidental myth Lemuria sinks into obscure depths once again 16 In the late 19th Century Lemuria was eagerly seized upon by occultists who like their scientific cousins wove it into elaborate evolutionary and racial theories In The Secret Doctrine a commentary on the Atlantean Book of Dzyan HP Blavatsky describes Lemuria as the third in a succession of lost continents It is preceded by Polarea and Hyperborea and followed by Atlantis which was built from a fragment of Western Lemuria Atlantis immediately precedes the modern world and two further continents are still to come According to Theosophical orthodoxy each such continent is the geographical aspect of a spiritual epoch providing a home for the series of seven Root Races The name of each lost continent is used ambiguously to designate both the core territory of the dominant root race of that age and also for the overall distribution of terrestrial landmass during that period in this latter respect it can even be seen as consistent with continental drift and thus as more highly developed than the original scientific conception L Sprague de Camp describes Blavatsky's third root race the ape-like hermaphroditic egg-laying Lemurians some with four arms and some with an eye in the back of their heads whose downfall was caused by their discovery of sex There is broad consensus amongst occultists that the rear-eye of the Lemurians persists vestigially as the human pineal gland W Scott Elliot adds that the Lemurians had huge feet the heels of which stuck out so far they could as easily walk backwards as forwards According to his account the Lemurians discovered sex during the period of the fourth sub-race interbreeding with beasts and producing the great apes This behavior disgusted the transcendent spirits or Lhas who were supposed to incarnate into the Lemurians but now refused The Venusians volunteered to take the place of the Lhas and also taught the Lemurians various secrets including those of metallurgy weaving and agriculture Rudolf Steiner was also fascinated by the Lemurians remarking in his Atlantis and Lemuria that This Root-Race as a whole had not yet developed memory The 'Lemurian was a born magician whose body was less solid plastic and unsettled' More recently Lemuria has been increasingly merged into Colonel James Churchward's lost pacific continent of Mu drifting steadily eastwards until even parts of modern California have been assimilated to it Although Blavatsky credits Sclater as the source for the name Lemuria it cannot have been lost upon her or her fellow occultists that Lemuria was a name for the land of the dead or the Western Lands The word Lemur is derived from Latin lemure literally shade of the dead The Romans conceived the lemures as vampireghosts propitiated by a festival in May In this vein Eliphas Levi writes in his History of Magic of Larvae and lemures shadowy images of bodies which have lived and of those which have yet to come issued from these vapours by myriads' 17 According to current scientific consensus Burroughs's figure of 160 million years is exaggerated Burroughs's geological tale is nevertheless a recognizably modern one with no reference to continental subsidence With the submergence of the Lemuria hypothesis however the presence of lemurs on Madagascar becomes puzzling Lemurs are only 55 million years old whilst Madagascar is now thought to have broken away from the African mainland 120 million years ago 18 Burroughs remarks of Mission He was himself an emissary of Panic of the knowledge that man fears above all else the truth of his origin GC 3 19 Burroughs drifts out of the White Magical orbit as his lemur commitments strengthen to the Board his support for the cause of Lemur conservation the Lemur Conservation Fund must have been the final and intolerable provocation 20 The physical conception of closed time-like curves invoke a causality from the future to make the past what it is They work to make things come out as they must If this is the only type of time-travel allowed by nature then it obviously shouldn't require a law to maintain it such as the notorious

Burroughs Reader eds James Grauerholz and Ira Silverberg Grove Press New York 1998 The Templeton Episode The name of Profesor Randolph Edmund Templeton is inextricably tangled with the secret perplexities of time It was he who by way of a yet barely comprehended time-anomaly provided the model for H P Lovecraft's Randolph Carter And yet it was this same R E Templeton who on March 21st 1999 whilst delivering a lecture at Miskatonic devoted to a rigorous critique of H G Wells awoke suddenly as the Thing that lurks behind the mask of Immanuel Kant coincidentally discoverering the transcendental time-machine Templeton sits immobile in his attic room immersed in the deceptively erratic ticking of his old nautical clock lost in meditation upon J C Chapman's hermetic engraving It now seems that this complex image long accepted as a portrait of Kant constitutes a disturbing monogram of his own chronological predicament As if in mockery of stable framing the picture is surrounded by strange-loop coilings of Ouraboros the cosmic snake who traces a figure of eight and of moebian eternity by endlessly swallowing itself Suspended from its lower jaw is a cryptic device of intricately balanced circles and stars ancient symbols of the AOE Above the serpent's head a facsimile of Kant is etched in profile the face fixed in an amiable if distant expression What was it though that hid behind the death-mask where it cut-off below and behind the jaw false ear and double hair-line What was this peculiarly formless body shadowy neck-flesh and suggestion of a cervical fin As he stared and hideously remembered Templeton felt as though he knew Templeton has long asserted the impossibility of empirical time-travel Since the ego is bound by its own nature to linear-sequentiality he continues to insist neither it nor the organism is ever transported through time Nevertheless he describes the Critique of Pure Reason as a time-travelling manual although of another kind He uses Kant's system as a guide for engineering time-synthesis The key is the secret of the Schematism which although an art concealed in the depths of the human soul concerns only the unutterable Abomenon of the Outside Nihil Ulterius In exteriority where time works that part of you which is most yourself has nothing in common with what you are When Templeton fell into himself that day he found instead of what he thought himself to be the Thing in itself at zero-intensity It was perhaps or necessarily that continuous hyperbody the Lurker at the Threshold which H P Lovecraft names Yog Sothoth Miskatonic Virtual University Can fiction become fact It always does when it's hyperfiction This special report takes us from the 1920s into the near future in a bid to track down the origins of a contemporary myth Some say that Miskatonic University is nothing more than a rumour or a joke Yet rumours have an unsettling ability to make things happen and jokes it is often said have a serious side My journey to the semi-fictional Miskatonic Virtual University hasn't yielded much that's definite But perhaps that's the point Starting with the most straightforward data such as it is MVU dates back to the early 1970s when the NW Peaslee Chair in Hydro-History was created for Professor Echidna Stillwell The University had no campus as such it still doesn't hence the Virtual of its title but was a loose agglomeration of scholars most affiliated to other institutions especially MIT Miskatonic had been described as the 'Shadow MIT What bound them together was a shared interest in the hyperfictional aspects of the work of H P Lovecraft MVU thus brings together experts in fictional systems mathematics physics geology semiotics all engaging in strange crossdisciplinary pollinations that if they are not actively forbidden are unsupported in any other academic institution The University has only one rule all of its meetings must take place in Lovecraft's beloved state of Massachusetts The story of MVU is inextricable from that of Echidna Stillwell Stillwell had done pioneering fieldwork in ethnology in the 1920s but her reputation quickly fell into eclipse University authorities began to fear that she had gone native credulously and uncritically adopting the strange folk beliefs of her beloved Mu N'Ma Some went so far as to suggest that she had been creative with her findings that much of her data had been simulated Fearing that they had a Blavatsky-type fake on their hands the University moved to dissociate themselves from her work A whispering campaign was orchestrated and Stillwell was first discredited and then 'forgotten by an anthropological community increasingly keen to establish its scientific credentials The result was that her voluminous works on Mu folklore went unpublished Complete disreputability was assured when her work began to be championed by occultists poets and cranks of every persuasion One of these champions was Captain Peter Vysparov But Vysparov was no lone obsessive or starry-eyed mystic To all outward appearances he was a respectable army Captain who had played a distinguished role in the Special Operations Executive during World War II Scratch the surface though and a stranger shadier picture begins to emerge Vysparov was a Russian emigre whose family had fled to the USA during the Revolution The Vysparovs were a reclusive family shrouded in rumour Serf legend had it that they had acquired their wealth through abominable magical pacts And sure enough rumours of occultism followed Peter Vysparov into World War II Coincidentally Vysparov had been posted to the same theatre where Stillwell had done much of her fieldwork He worked with the Dibboma the degraded rump of the Dib N'Ma who were one of the three original N'Ma tribes It was said that Vysparov had employed unorthodox means in his war against the Japanese using Dibboma sorcerers in a magical war Since Vysparov's methods highly successful military High Command were not overly concerned to investigate them And neither was much anyone else In 1947 an American journalist began to research the story but he was unable to substantiate anything before an untimely yet apparently accidental death It is only with the recent release of correspondence between Vysparov and Stillwell that the events of the war which throw a great deal of light on the subsequent development of Miskatonic have become clearer The provenance of this correspondence it should be pointed out is still highly disputed The Stillwell estate notoriously and understandably touchy is reluctant to confirm the authenticity of the letters while lawyers acting for the Vysparov family made strenuous but ultimately failed efforts to suppress the correspondence Nevertheless Dr Edward Blake the author of a forthcoming Stillwell biography believes that the letters are genuine They bear many of Stillwell's characteristic stylistic traits and all the facts seem to square with the available data If they're a fake they're an incredibly detailed one I'd certainly like to meet someone with knowledge of Professor Stillwell this precise' Origins of the Cthulhu Club Captain Peter Vysparov to Dr Echidna Stillwell 19th March 1949 Dear Dr Stillwell I have been fortunate enough to encounter your ethnographic work on the Nma which I have studied with very great interest May I trouble you with an account of my own which might be of relevance to your researches During the recent Pacific conflict a peculiar oxymoron I was deployed covertly into the Dibboma area of Eastern Sumatra My mission which was categorized under psychological operations consisted basically of attempted cultural manipulation with the aim of triggering a local insurgency against the Japanese occupation I hope it will not distress you unduly if I confess that your work was a crucial resource in this undertaking which involved intense if patently exploitative communication with Dibboma witchcraft My only excuse is that hard times require moral hardness and even obvious cruelties I was obeying orders and accepted them as necessary Beyond confirming your own conclusions these activities brought me into proximity with phenomena for which I was cognitively ill-prepared What began as a merely opportunistic usage of Dibboma lore conceived initially as native superstition transmuted incrementally into a sorcerous war against the enemy garrison In just two weeks between March 15th 29th 1944 three consecutive Japanese commanders were incapacitated by severe mental break-down In each of these cases the process of deterioration followed the same rapid course from leadership dysfunction through violent assaults on subordinate personnel to berserk derangement and paranoid ravings culminating in suicide By the end of this period the order of the occupying forces had entirely disintegrated It would be dishonest of me to conceal the fact that the Dibbomese paid a devastatingly heavy price for this success On the basis of this experience I cannot easily doubt that Dibboma sorcerors are in some way able to telepathically communicate extreme conditions of psychotic dissociation It is with great reluctance that I accept such a radical hypothesis but alternative explanations such as poisoning disease or coincidence stretch credibility even further Yours with sincere admiration Captain Peter Vysparov PS I cannot help noticing that the dates concerned as also of this letter are strangely Lovecraftian Dr Echidna Stillwell to Captain Peter Vysparov 23rd March 1949 Abridged Dear Captain Vysparov Thank you for your frank letter of the 19th March I found it truly horrifying and yet also fascinating I appreciate that it cannot have been easy to write I shall not attempt to hide the great distress your account caused me adding as it does such a terrible episode to the modern history of these cruelly aﬄicted people Whilst already suspecting that this ghastly war might have stricken the Nma yet further it is crushing indeed to have my darkest thoughts thus confirmed I would be interested in learning more about the details of Dib-Nma sorcerous practice before attempting to respond to your hypothesis Be assured that after spending seven years amongst the Mu-Nma I will not hastily judge anything you communicate as wild or fanciful As far as the question of dates is concerned which you indicate only elliptically I assume that you are referring to what in Northern latitudes constitutes the Spring Equinoctial period mid to later March which is so emphatically stressed in Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu and which also coincidentally comprises the intense-zone of Nma time-ritual This complicity has long intrigued me As I am sure you are aware Lovecraft had a peculiar obsession with the South-Seas a thematic coalescence of almost hypnotic ethnographic fascination with the most abysmal and primitive dread I have attempted to correspond with him about these issues but found that this topic quickly punctured his thin-crust of supercilious New-England rationalism exposing an undercurrent of heavily fetishized archaic terror mixed with extreme racial paranoia When he began referring to the rich and subtle culture of the Mu-Nma as the repugnant cult of semi-human Dagonite savages I broke off communication Despite this unfortunate argument I consider Mr Lovecraft's fictions to be documents of the greatest importance and welcome the opportunity to discuss them further In addition my own Neolemurian Hypothesis intersects with his wider terrestrial and cosmic vision in a number of crucial respects particularly insofar as nonhuman cultural factors are seen to play a decisive role in large-scale historical developments Captain Peter Vysparov to Dr Echidna Stillwell 3rd April 1949 Extract I am afraid you are right to suspect that I have reserved certain aspects of my engagement with Dibboma sorcery perhaps from fear of ridicule What has so far been omitted from my sketch of telepathic psychosis which I will now relate is the source pathos so to speak or in the words of the military officer I was then the occult ammunition manufacture Not only did I learn of the Japanese command being wrecked by psychological cataclysm both by conventional and decidedly nonconventional intelligence gathering processes I was also witness to the assembly of the weapon itself I had then and still have no doubt at all that the madness breaking out in the local Japanese headquarters was the very same thing that I saw brewing-up like a dust-vortex in the Oddubbite trances of a Dibbomese witch who I came to see as my greatest tactical asset and most valued companion in that order I confess It was an experience of soul-carving horror for me to witness this meticulously deliberated descent into the splintering of self complete personality disintegration which she somehow traversed and which she called shattering the mirror of existence I gathered that this expression originally referred to the surface of still water but since the arrival of European colonists silvered mirrors have been highly treasured and their pulverization invested with immense ceremonial significance Dibbomese sorcery does not seem to be at all interested in judgements as to truth or falsity It appears rather to estimate in each case the potential to make real saying typically 'perhaps it can become so Echidna Stillwell to Peter Vysparov 19th April 1949 Extract Whilst respecting the candour of your account I cannot but abominate the necessity that has led the Nma and their sorcerous abilities to be conceived and utilized as mere munitions in a conflict imposed upon them from without From what I can reconstruct from your description it seems to mark a degeneration of Nma demonism and time-sorcery into mere magic or the imposition of change in accordance with will in this case the will in question being the overall policy and strategic goals of the US war-effort microcosmically represented by your own evidently gallant competent and persuasive military office Forgive my lack of patriotic ardour but it strikes me as an appalling indication of cultural decay and corrosive nihilism when a Dib-Nma witch allows herself to be employed as a crude assassin however one evaluates the cause thus served This is all a matter of deepest regret although not to my way of thinking of individual culpability As the Mu-Nma say in their bleakest moments nove eshil zo raka Time is in love with her own pain' Your discussion of Oddubb-trance makes no mention of temporal anomaly This surprizes me The Mu had immense respect for those Dibba witches who they described as returning from the Oddubb-time to come and the Mu-Nagwi or dreamwitches often claimed to meet these back-travellers in the Vault of Murmurs where they would learn about future times They said however that this time is compressing and soon ends although I had not imagined the end to be so imminent Remembering this omen returns me to abysmal melancholy consoled only by another Mu-Nma saying lemu ta novu meh novu nove Lemuria does not pass as time passes I shall try to think things thus As you say with the Dibbomese shleth hud dopesh perhaps it can become so Peter Vysparov to Echidna Stillwell 7th May 1949 Extract Dear Dr Stillwell Here in Massachusettes we have been convening a small Lovecraft reading-group dedicated to exploring the intersection between the Nma cultural constellation Cthulhoid contagion and twisted time-systems We are interested in fiction only insofar as it is simultaneously hyperstition a term we have coined for semiotic productions that make themselves real cryptic communications from the Old Ones signalling return shleth hud dopesh This is the ambivalence or loop of Cthulhu-fiction who writes and who is written It seems to us that the fabled Necronomicon sorcerous counter-text to the Book of Life is of this kind and furthermore that your recovery of the Lemurodigital Pandemonium Matrix accesses it at its hypersource I hope it is superfluous to add that any directly participative involvement on your part would be most extravagantly appreciated Echidna Stillwell to Peter Vysparov 28th May 1949 Extract It is with some trepidation that I congratulate you on the inauguration of your Cthulhu Club if I may call it such Whilst not in any way accusing you of frivolity I feel bound to state the obvious warning Cthulhu is not to be approached lightly My researches have led me to associate this Chthonian entity with the deep terrestrial intelligence inherent in the electromagnetic cauldron of the inner earth in all of its intense reality raw potentiality and danger According to the Nma she is the plane of Unlife a veritable Cthelll who is trapped under the sea only according to a certain limited perspective and those who set out to traffick with her do so with the very greatest respect and caution That her submerged Pacific city of R'lyeh is linked to a Lemuro-Muvian culturestrain seems most probable but the assumption that she was ever a surfacedweller in a sense we would straightforwardly understand can only be an absurd misconstrual It is much more likely that Cthulhu's rising like that of Kundalini as it was once understood is a drawing down and under a restoration of contact with abysmal intensities Why would Cthulhu ever surface She does not need rescuing for she has her own line of escape trajected through profundity Much of this relates to the occult teachings of the sub-chakras in zones of Indo-Lemurian influence Hyperstition strikes me as a most intriguing coinage We thought we were making it up but all the time the Nma were telling us what to write and through them The Vault of Murmurs She bore another monster terrible In a hollow cave Echidna fierce of heart Nothing like any mortal man unlike Any immortal god half of her Is a fair-cheeked girl with glancing eyes but half Is a huge and frightening speckled snake she eats Raw flesh in a recess of the holy earth Down there she has a cave of hollow rock Far from the depthless gods and mortal men There the gods gave a famous home to her And gloomy Echidna keeps her watch down there Under the ground among the Arimoi A nymph immortal and ageless all her days Hesiod Theogony I think now looking back that the dreams return can be dated to 1925 the moment of my arrival in the Sunda Strait It began as insidious seepage waves of vaguely familiar but disconnected fragments whose secret cohesion I could dimly perceive I had been drawn to the Mu N'Ma by their reputed traditions of dream-sorcery which offered a singular opportunity for converting my studies of Freud and Frazer into practical field work Although it might seem ironical that a student of Freud could be so oblivious to their subterranean motivations I shared with my generation a profound and unquestioning faith in the spirit of objective scientific inquiry and little suspected or had forgotten the deeper currents guiding a lifelong interest in the phenomena of dreams The N'Ma people had gained some public noteriety through their role in the strange case of Cecil Curtis I myself had first learned of the Mu through tantalising references in the burgeoning literature that had transformed the events of Curtis' ill-fated expedition into something of a modern myth Most of these accounts had underplayed the role of the two other tribes in the N'Ma system but the occasional hint about the Mu and their dream rites was more than sufficient to provoke in me an interest that would quickly shade into obsession By the time I arrived in Indonesia the tripartite N'Ma system was in shreds In totally annihilating one tribe Curtis Tak N'Ma and all but destroying another the Dib N'Ma the 1883 explosion of Krakatoa had wrecked the complex web of social exchange on which the Mu had traditonally depended An atmosphere of terrible desolation overhung them and I could be under no illusion that the Mu were little more than a shadow of what they had been in the days prior to the cataclysm These were a haunted people whose continuing survival seemed a dubious blessing at best In this apocalyptic atmosphere it was inevitable that my thoughts should increasingly turn to the days immediately preceding the catastrophe and to its herald Cecil Curtis Following Curtis footsteps into N'Ma territory I read the famous few surviving fragments of his journal with a renewed sense of puzzlement and disquiet None of the speculations on Curtis final days had to my mind adequately made sense of the peculiar trajectory his delirium took The lay observer might be tempted to think his words mere ravings but for those like myself who had fallen under Freud's spell the compulsion to search for the hidden logics that guide and structure supposedly random manias is irresistable What dark events coalesced to produce Curtis madness I read key passages over and over again 17th July 1883 I know now that I will never leave this place The jungle is rotting me into nothingness My supplies are exhausted Clouds of mosquitoes torment me and I am plagued by the pounding crushing smothering heat 28th July 1883 I have broken from everything in any case participated in something abominable behind the tattered masks of man and God Christian civilization is no better than the prancing of savages How could human fellowship exist after this By now the Tak N'Ma's ferocity is legendary they were the most unspeakable savages on earth according to one of Curtis less ethnographically sensitive biographers The same source remarked that the Tak N'Ma rites could not be contemplated by any decent Christian without risk of the loss of his mind These practices coupled with the ravages of the malaria which aﬄicted Curtis in his final days would have been enough to completely unhinge any European male even one as famously thick-skinned as Cecil Mad Dog Curtis But Curtis seemed in the end to confront an awful revelation whose enormous horror could not be reduced to these two factors rather the disease and the Tak rituals were themselves he seemed to imply part of some senseless pattern in which his whole life was always fated to be engulfed 24th August 1883 Needless to say the Limbic Key continues to elude me I strongly suspect it is a fiction The Order are pursuing a chimera the sense of destiny has not departed however On the contrary I was meant to be here irrespective of the motives of those who sent me Other forces were at work I have been chosen since the beginning of time Curse this blasphemous fate My daytime obsession with Curtis transferred easily into dreams in which Curtis featured heavily in terribly vivid nightmares I sometimes felt I was meeting Curtis at other times I had the uncanny conviction that I was seeing the jungle landscape through his fever-darkened eyes Given the circumstances these nocturnal encounters were hardly unmotivated but the dreams had a naggingly intimate quality about them As if I had experienced them them many times before and was only now remembering them The intense oppressively subdued atmosphere that benighted Mu N'Ma culture was in every way at odds with the excitement that leapt into my heart as I learned more about it It was immediately evident that Mu culture was indeed based upon a system of dream magic in which the Nago or dream witch occupied an exalted position The Nago fulfills a wide-ranging oracular function in Mu culture Medicine the settlement of disputes advice and counsel all are in the Dream Witch's power Those who sought her wisdom would make solitary pilgrimages to the temple bearing appropriate gifts A simple ritual follows during which they offer sacrifices and make requests On the night following it is said they receive a Nagwi or 'dream visit' It is said of the Nago that she never speaks except in dreams When I asked to visit the Nago the Mu elders merely nodded showing neither enthusiasm nor hostility They greeted my entreaty with the same sense of fated inevitabilty with which they seemed to accept all matters The Nago's temple is located on the side of a cliff an hour's trek through thick jungle fittingly for a people whose deity Mur Mur is a sea creature a dreaming serpent it is sometimes said the temple looks out upon the ocean As I was guided through the primeval vegetation I thought once more of Cecil Curtis and the Tak N'Ma 11th August 1883 The language of these savages is impenetrable They now promise to take me to Katak To meet myself therefore Or perhaps a rabid dog The fatal irony of this entry has often been remarked upon by commentators Curtis would only understand the N'Ma's taxonomy too late Curtis's Christian thinking would have been little assistance in unravelling the Tak belief system the fact that the Tak's god Katak was manifested in dogs volcanoes and indeed Curtis himself could only appear nonsensical to a man of his time and background Curtis must have at first assumed that the Tak's apparent reverence for him was the natural response of savages to their betters He could not have suspected as he was annointed by the Taks that he was destined to be the sacrificial harbinger of the Taks ultimate destruction Perhaps it was only towards the end that he realised that his arrival and the apocalyptic eruption of Krakatoa had always been coincident in Tak folklore their tribal stories said that the fiery End would be the heralded by the arrival of the white Katak Mad Dog Curtis 27th August 1883 The fever has melted away the walls between waking and sleep Consciousness has become a loathsome fog I sense that the incessant rumbling of volcanic activity is connected with the visions that plague me constantly now it felt as if I were carried down my spine Things ancient beyond imagination beyond the ultimate gate of ruin and insanity oceans of subterranean fire So Curtis final days became a veritable journey into hell The Curtis biography I had with me in Indonesia contained facsimiles of the journal showing a marked decline in the handwriting By the end the hand was so spidery that one was almost tempted to query the attribution could this barely legible scrawl have been produced by the same individual My head still full of Curtis I was led into the Vault of Murmurs the sacred cavern below the Nago temple in which the Dream Witch receives her supplicants The Nago sat at the other end of the grotto folded into its deep shadows Feeling a sense of uncanny familiarity I asked the inevitable question Where was Curtis taken The Nago nodded and left her silence unbroken in accordance with custom The next morning I awoke to a feeling of immense anti-climax I ransacked my mind for traces of the previous night's dreams recalling nothing Yet through this almost painful disappointment older memories surfaced dating I sensed with icy certainty from my seventh year It was the night of the Century's Eve 31st December 1899 No Freudian scholar can miss the significance of the year 1899 the date of the first publication of The Interpretation of Dreams A female voice spoke Echidna Echidna wake up I had assumed previously if such a time-designation makes any sense that this was the voice of my mother Now I knew it was the voice of the Nago speaking to me in my own tongue But I was no longer sure to whom or what it was addressed I was entirely carried away My body felt impossible Touching my face I encountered only the features and limbs of a little girl Below the waist however all was confusion snaking endlessly into itself or rather into depths beyond sense traversed by languid spinal waves that culminated in a distant hint of a tail My dream body floated in what appeared to be an undersea cavern As I lay there I beheld moving toward me with grim purpose a raft carrying a solemn spectral party I recognised from the many books recounting the Curtis legend the crimson markings and ceremonial masks of the Tak N'Ma And on the raft with them reclining in a malarial swoon dressed in Tak ritual garb was the unmistakable figure of Cecil Curtis They were bringing him to me Except I was dissolving becoming indistinguishable from the water which held me And when I turned again to where Curtis had been but a moment ago I heard only anguished gargles the growls and snarls of some creature that seemed to be part dog part cat barely human I felt claws in what should have been my side Then there was a plume of blood which I at first thought was mine but when I looked again I saw it gouting from the other creature's flesh which I was suddenly aware was becoming absorbed into me even as my body was losing any sense of its limits Warped perceptions danced past my dream eyes Darting acceleration and abyssal slowness fused in a wholly unfamiliar time-sense I suddenly became aware of the cyclopean edifices of a lost civilization though civilization scarcely seemed the word for the alien vistas that swam before me swarming city-shoals quivering with a wholly inorganic animation Something told me a whisper or an intuition in that dreaming ocean both blended utterly that this was the lost continent of Lemuria speculated upon by contemporary archaeologists and mystics What was left of my mammal body flickered out of focus it felt clumsy all fingers and thumbs As I looked down at my hands they became transluscent and I saw inscribed into the impossible geometries of the dream cave's wall beyond an arrangement of ten circles a number of smaller circles and a series of interconnecting lines This was my first encounter with what came to be called the Numogram It was only later that I was able to uncover the numeric relations encrypted in its ancient patterns the dream showed me only the shapes and their relations But even in those early hallucinatory minutes as I made my first hurried transcriptions of the dream-image I knew that I had in front of me a key that would unlock all the secrets of my life A labyrinth had opened up a labyrinth whose complexities could be contained no more by our supernaturalisms than by our sciences It was a labyrinth in which my fate and that of the N'Ma Cecil Curtis and more cosmic presences had always been tangled together I was unravelled in this maze of coincidences and could do nothing but follow its threads forever Tchattuk Stories concerning Tchattuk Stillwell tells us invariably refer to Tchattuk stealing something from Katak Devotees of Tchattuk insist that it is this act of theft which triggers Katak's journey around the time-cycle Tchattuk is both she-who-steals and what-is-lost simultaneously wounding Katak and making her what she is It is easy to see why Tchattuk was held in special reverence by the Tak N'Ma and why that reverence had a peculiarly ambivalent quality The Tak language had a special word for this admixture of dread and love Tukka According to the Mu N'Ma and the Dibboma the Taks would stage bloody ceremonies in honour of Tchattuk Tak rituals would show Tchattuk swooping from the sky sometimes to take Katak up into the stars with her sometimes to take what she had stolen from Katak into the dark regions of the cosmos Tchattuk is sometimes called the strange-lights and there are persistent hints of an extraterrestrial origin Mu sorcerers who follow Tchattuk talk of riding her to the whirlpool beyond This 'ride however is anything but an easy journey Impairment and even destruction of memory is always a feature of the voyage The word Tchattu common to all three N'Ma tribes is used to refer to amnesia and senile dementia its literal meaning is taken by Tchattuk Some of those who specialize in the Tchattuk-ride pride themselves on their inability to remember anything The constant connections between Tchattuk and missing time indicate that this is an entity especially connected with calendrics Some say that the Taks treated the N'Ma calendar with the intercalated extra three days as the full calendar and the 729-day cycle as a calendar shortened by Tchattuk's act of theft The most intense Tchattuk feasts it is said always took place during these three days";
