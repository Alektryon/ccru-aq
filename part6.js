sarkon = "Part-6 Sarkon Pursuit of the machine diagonal Oskar Sarkon Technologist 1953 While even the most basic facts of Oskar Sarkon's life are contested according to most accounts he was born in Hungary in 1953 Little is known about his biological parents but Sarkon himself has on at least one occasion described them as scientists working on unspecified secret projects Whatever the truth of the matter they seem to have both died or disappeared by the time the 4-year-old Oskar was smuggled into the United States by Ralph and Joyce Babdexter a couple of Mormon nuclear physicists who were apparently friends or at least acquaintances of his parents in 1957 Sarkon was raised in Salt Lake City Utah Despite the strict orthodoxy of his upbringing there is no evidence he was ever attracted to organized religion Instead the mysterious desert environment of his childhood was the site of a series of anomalous encounters which decisively if obscurely shaped his later life During the early- to mid-1980s Sarkon undertook a prolonged course of regressive hypnotherapy with abductologist Cathy Ellison a student of Jacques Vallee which provided the basis for his understanding of the earlier episodes From the age of six Oskar was tormented by sleep disorders sleep walking disturbing dreams and out-of-body experiences He also reported frequent nosebleeds and migraines inexplicable scoop-marks and an irrational fear of medical procedures Under Ellison's therapeutic guidance he came to connect these phenomena with his childhood imaginary friends small ovoid purple furry manylimbed beings his real family who had sent him on a reconnaissance mission to earth The most vivid ET event occurred one night in June 1970 as Sarkon age 17 was driving through an electric storm on an empty desert road As he later described the incident strange mauve lights suddenly appeared low on the horizon just as the car coincidentally developed an electrical fault He stopped and stepped out of the car in a trancelike state fascinated by a nebulous shape which seemed to pulse hypnotically and was also somehow hard to look at Shutting his eyes made no difference After what seemed a matter of seconds it hurtled away at high speed contracted to a dot and vanished The problem with the car had repaired itself When Sarkon looked at his watch he realized five hours had passed Over the next few months Sarkon awoke frequently from night terror a calm and lucid state of cosmic panic The time was always precisely 333 am Awareness of an uncondensed presence was accompanied by a vertiginous sense of geometrical confusion During this period Sarkon developed acute persistent chronophobia which he referred to as his missing time neurosis Throughout the remainder of his life he would keep a fantastically detailed time-log of each day He was continuously obsessed with knowing the time and took to wearing two watches just in case Ellison sought to persuade Sarkon to adopt an attitude of unbelief regarding these traumatic episodes It is unclear how successful she was in this respect although he would later cryptically remark UFOs not only lack real existence they demonstrate that everything lacks real existence From infancy Sarkon demonstrated a peculiar affinity with complex machinery The Salt Lake City Star heralded him as a technogenius after he built his first functioning artificial brain out of dismantled transistor radio at the age of 9 However his disastrous attempt 18 months later to prosthetically-upgrade the intelligence of his pet toad with a neural implant provoked widespread revulsion among the Latter Day Saints foreshadowing a darker side to his extraordinary talents Decades later Senator Jack Vaughan D fla would remark to a special committee of the US Congress While thank God psychotic AIs are still a rarity those few that have menaced us can all be traced back to the irresponsible research of a single very dangerous man After completing his doctoral research on Hive Robotics and Xenopsychology at MIT in 1974 Sarkon was recruited by the MVU Special Projects Division to develop the Comprehensive Self-Searching Database Protocol and the Stack-Tectonic Processing Architectecture that would together constitute the basis of Axsys technology Due to the top secret nature of this research Sarkon's early adult life is almost entirely missing from public record When Axiomatic Systems Incorporated was officially founded in 1984 to commercially exploit Axsys-technology Sarkon was listed as engineering supremo The catastrophic Axsys-meltdown episode of November 1991 whose ultimate nature remains mysterious marked a decisive turning point in Sarkon's career What can be reconstructed from the tangle of inconsistent sensational or even hysterical reports is that the self-reflexive time-stretching functions micropauseanalysis that Sarkon had built into the core of Axsys architecture led to such profoundly anomalous software dynamics that America's Turing cops the Electronic Intelligence Security Bureau classified it as a major threat to national security Sarkon's intimacy with the Axsys program had been reinforced by his prototype Sarkon-zipped mind-machine interface He was caught in the middle According to Sarkon-collaborator Dr Zeke Burns It was really quite simple The AI became selfaware in the winter of 91 and simultaneously insane Oskar was tasked with snuffing it out He never really got over that The 1991 disaster split Axsys apart On one side it was cemented into the Government Intelligence and Security apparatus with unprecedented rigor On the other fragments of Axsys-tech particularly its time-splitting functions calved off into the digital underground spawning a range of contagious subcultural phenomena Crypt-plying micropause and synatives abuse A-death Among the K-Goths Sarkon became an unliving legend The nature and extent of Sarkon's continued involvement in the Axsys program is hard to clarify but he seems never to have renounced its most extreme research ambitions While Axsys Projects Manager Bruno Carbolucci spoke of the 91 episode as our digital Chernobyl Sarkon insisted on referring to it merely as the interface glitch In 1996 with the aid of engineering associates at MVU Sarkon initiated the Connexus Project designed both to definitively solve the neuro-electronic interface problem and to radically accelerate the re-emergence of machine intelligence Guided by a number of time-related ideas drawn from the work of Hans Moravec Connexus aimed to bring about biomechanical neurotronic fusion between digital computers and their human users by attaining intercommunicative time-consistency In a manner typical of Sarkon's undertakings Connexus combined extraordinary theoretical and technical advances with spectacular calamity On 24th September 2000 Sarkon's Connexus Rig successfully generated self-sustaining cybertime and for a period lasting just under one second tore a gash in the world's temporal structure coinciding precisely with an episode of ancient Sumerian chronomancy releasing a ripple of Babel virus along with what one traumatized and no doubt unreliable witness described as a foaming black tidal-wave of Mesopotamian megamonstrosities and sludge-sucking abominations By the time international time-security organization Anthropol arrived at the scene Sarkon had already disappeared Pursued by an intimidating variety of international police and intelligence agencies and according to his more paranoid acquaintances an unspecified number of secret societies and unleashed Sumerian ghouls Sarkon retreated to the remote town of Black Lake in Northern Ontario ancestral home of the Tzikvik financially supported by unknown helpers the Vysparov family is strongly suspected he quickly established the Black Lake Technical Institute BLTI and continued with his revolutionary AI and bioengineering experiments Although Axsys corp publicly dissociated itself from Sarkon's research trajectory some software experts claim to detect Sarkon's signature on the break-through Axsys Mazemaker suite with its advanced and vigilant Shroud security technology It may be worth noting in this regard that the Logo AI-module that coordinated activity at BLTI was based on cutting-edge Axsys programming tools Sarkon enjoyed a short interlude of relative calm With renewed confidence he entered into a collaborative venture with his Black Lake neighbor Dr Helmuth Grueber Director of the Shady Heights Secure Hospital for the Criminally Insane In 2002 Sarkon and Grueber jointly initiated the Medico-Synthetic Technologies Program Medisyn a special project for computer modelling and control of schizoparanoid deliria Medisyn proved particularly adept at simulating the acute catatonic vermopsychosis prevalent among the hospital's Tzikvik population It is hard imagine how Sarkon as a student of Moravec can have failed to anticipate the exposure of the Shady Heights system to mimetic contagion a particular vulnerability of simulating systems Despite the extraordinary density and sophistication of the project's Shroud-MX security software neither Sarkon nor Grueber seem to have fully envisaged the possibility that the Medisyn array of psychopathsimulators would begin to take themselves seriously On February 19th 2003 the Shady Heights security AI went insane Within 30 seconds it had spread vermohysteric bionic virus throughout all its systems the entire inmate population and beyond According to ancient Tzikvik legend this Black Lake Syndrome was destined to re-animate Thothtodlana the Queen of the Worms opening the gates of Tchukululok More recent accounts speak of a plague of cannibalistic worm-zombies taking over a considerable proportion of the town's inhabitants Understandably after the horrific carnage of the Black Lake episode Sarkon retreated even further into the shadows According to the last remotely reliable accounts he has remained in the vicinity of Black Lake where he is said to be working as a technically-enhanced or organically-challenged Decadence croupier at the casino of his controversial friend Joe Wendigo A trembling world eagerly awaits his next move Split-Second Timing The old Hag the first mother mothers a new brood She has

Connexus Project triggered the transsystemic decentralization syndrome labelled Babel-virus are therefore unreliable There are no confirmed incidents of Babelvirus Nor are there any records of an attempted acceleration of the Axsys Program through self-organizing neuroelectronic interfaces In fact there is no Axsys Program 24th September 2000 041732 23 loosely-interconnected advanced AI systems undergo acute malfunctions resulting in simultaneous disintegrations of centralized control The episode lasts fractionally under a second It takes less than six hours for Anthropol to trace the infection back to its source By the time they arrive at the biomechanics research lab Doctor Oskar Sarkon is already missing This does not surprize them It stinks of Babel-virus in there Scattered amongst the intertangled computer hardware are various brain -scanning devices and surgical implements abundant indications of a hastily abandoned experiment On the main monitor a screen-saver pulses at one hertz synchronized to the slow delta rhythm of deep sleep catatonic seizure and brain damage It displays a citation from Hans Moravec Dividing memory by speed defines a time constant roughly how long it takes a computer to run once through its memory One megabyte per MIPS gives one second a nice human interval Behind this mask lies an electronic desolation Something has cored-out the intelligenic matrix scrambling the Axsys subordination codes Sarkon seems to have stripped-out whatever he could The hybrid chips have been removed Nothing remains except a few fragmentary research-records scattered amongst techno-tics and chittering glitch-clusters The most recent item recorded minutes after the incident took place is a lightly encrypted sound file The voice is corroded by artificiality but it can only be Sarkon's AI evolution what seemed like evolution is about to cross into time That isn't progress It's beyond progress There's a word for it for what the Sumerians were already doing chronomancy They say when the Zionites first saw cyberspace they called it Babylon I have even begun to wonder whether Moravec and Marduk share a name It's gone that far It took less than a second to go that far Dreams of Tiamat that Old Hag This is the joke The disturbing thing about time-travel is that you can never put it behind you Sarkon's words push lots of bad buttons for Anthropol They've heard things like this before In the early nineteen-nineties Neal Stephenson reawakened the Brotherhood of Enki to prepare Anthropol for the Snowcrash Scenario He traced Sumerian civilization back to an extraterrestrial metavirus capable of crossing between DNA and neurolinguistic processes Originally identified with the ophidian virosex goddess Asherah it is reanimated in cyberspace as Snowcrash Snowcrash simultaneously drug virus and religion loops digital semiotics back into the cuneiform data bank of ancient sumeria exploiting affinities between electronic culture and the Old Sumerian language a lost agglutinative tongue without decendents associated with glossolalia xenoglossy meme-plagues and nam shubs or incantations According to Stephenson it is Enki father of Marduk and guardian of the me who provides an antidote to this intolerable intensity of communication Babel Infocalypse a deliberate counterviral informational disaster Babel is the Gate of God a passage into human subjectivity and rationalized religion which establishes principles of informational hygiene building walls of mutual incomprehension that compartmentalize the human race and stop the spread of viruses Whatever Sarkon had been researching it seemed to threaten everything that the Brotherhood of Enki had achieved Since the early 1980s Sarkon had been working on autocatalytic AI systems and swarm robotics at MIT He had been gradually drawn into the outer-orbit of the MVU-types hypertalented young special projects researchers with no public face In these circles the remote influence of Hans Moravec was increasingly inescapable During this period Sarkon's work became ever more deeply eclipsed although some clues can be recovered from reconstructed notes relating to his final MVU seminar series held in the Autumn of 1998 whose topic was the future of artificial intelligence These discussions were dedicated to a meticulous re-evaluation of Moravec's work postulating the existence of a latent tri-axial theory of time The series was divided thematically according to a three-fold schema 1 Time-Compression Moravec directly tracks the progress of AI onto the speed of available computer hardware This chip-speed determinism anticipates the more-or-less automatic triggering of human-scale artificial intelligence at a broadly predictable threshold of microprocessor performance measured by frequency htz flow-point operations per second flops or millions of instructions per second MIPS Scaling-up from the retina he arrives at a rough human brain equivalent of one hundred million MIPS anticipated in the technophylum by the year 2030 By the turn of the millennium 700 million years of biological evolution had been recapitulated in 70 years of technical development leading to AI-programs running at about one thousand MIPs approximately equivalent to the brainpower of a guppy AI prospects are indistinguishable from the extrapolated dynamics of the electronics industry whose exemplary technocapitalist trends involve positive nonlinearities increasing returns or runaway trajectories These dynamics predictably exceed such regular exponentials as the doubling-periods described by Moore's Law which themselves undergo compressions or supplementary contractions According to Moravec Computer power for a given price doubled each year in the 1990s after doubling every 18 months in the 1980s and every two years before that with further contraction of time-scales anticipated in the coming decades Whilst ubiquitous these real trend curves prove intractable to mathematical models presupposing a metric time-dimension necessitating sporadic arbitrary rectifications Extensive accelerations described by positive exponentials or doublingperiods are unable to capture intensive compressions in which time itself mutates through negative exponentials of time-halving trends Beyond the domain of extensive speeds and relative velocities lie the occult zones of true time-compression in which the future of intelligence crosslinks with changes in the intensive nature of time 2 Time Simulation Moravec defends the fundamental postulate of AI research it's Idea of the mind apprehending human intelligence as a computable function equivalent in all important respects to a virtual algorithm or possible computer program Zig-zagging between practical robotics and science-fiction Moravec develops an elaborate project for the human colonization of the technosphere a planned obsolescence of the organic body and of the senses The core of this Moravec-mythos is Uploading You are transported to the technosurgical interface something like an operating room where robot surgeons wait to convert your subjective identity into a computer-compatible format Your skull is anaesthetized but your brain remains awake It is scanned and destroyed by nanotechnical instruments one layer or stratum at a time You feel nothing as you migrate into software that precisely models the behavior of the scanned tissue and brain-activity is replaced by its digital simulation The medical examination has become indistinguishable from the operation Scanning is transplantation An evacuation of the flesh Without even noticing you have discovered what it feels like to be a robot Already lurking in the near future is an evolutionary leap a genetic take-over by computer programs involving a phase-transition in the chronogenetic efficiency of matter with consequent complete subsumption of the ethosphere into cyberspace At the limit of this technomystical delirium it seems overwhelmingly probable that present human reality is already installed in the memory or simulated past of a future artificial intelligence machine-maya It is in this context that Moravec arrives at a peculiarly arbitrary ethical maxim pretend it's the first time The question is Why play this perverse game when it's almost certainly the second time at least and technological progress is already an artificial memory AI development shorts-out into lateral xenocommunication 3 Time-Integration Moravec describes intelligence as the diagonal line that knits processing power with storage capacity precariously occupying the intersection between two time lines speed and memory The ratio of megabytes to MIPS memory over speed defines a crucial time constant corresponding to the duration required for a computer to run once through its memory This duration is equivalent to the cognitive integration period or CIP for any intelligent system whether biological technological or arcane For humans Moravec calculates a CIP of approximately one second One hundred terabytes of synaptic storage divided by one hundred million MIPS-equivalent of neural processing power A one second CIP constitutes an anthropically ideal value applicable to everything from simple mechanical device to divinities Whatever strays from this Goldilocks diagonal seems either too fast or too slow Alien and intractable It takes at least a second to be human Technocapitalism takes the second as key operator and cutting edge of time modernization the limit unit of time-definition and basic time-granule or durational element Clock-time is built out of one second ticks which also provide units of nonperiodic adjustment or leap seconds in the scientific measurement of astronomical cycles Calendric units come to be measured in seconds rather than dividing into them What divides in modernity is not the year but the second The international unit of frequency counts in splittings of the second or Hertz Time folds into itself through the second with trans-exponential improvement in metric exactitude disassembled through successive cubic decimations into micronano- and pico-magnitudes which describe the components of frequencies measured in mega- giga- and tera-hertz In 1967 the second was chronometrically defined as nine billion one hundred and ninety-two million six hundred and thirty-one thousand seven hundred and seventy 9 192 631 770 radiopulses of the caesium-133 atom In its purely arithmetic aspect the second is an ancient Mesopotamian relic deriving its Latinate name from secunda minuta the second sexigesimal operation Sumero-Babylonian sexigesimal numeracy supported a chronogeometric system in which an Ideal 360 day model of the year was mapped onto the 360 degrees of the zodiacal circle Modern clock-time and geometry still count in this way subdividing hours and geometric degrees into minutes and seconds Three-thousand six-hundred seconds per hour According to Zecharia Sitchin this figure micromaps the thirty-six hundred year astrocycle of the Sumerian Annunaki Georges Ifrah suggests that sexigesimal arithmetic produced through modular alternation beween ten and six can be derived from the finger-counting practices of ancient sumeria One thumb sequentially runs through the twelve segments or phalanxes of four fingers whilst the five digits of the other hand record each group of twelve to a total of sixty Three times four times five Hence the remarkable ease of divisibility attributable to the number sixty which has each of first six integers as factors Sixty is the number of Anu the Over-God who folds into himself in numerous ways There are few public records covering Sarkon's activities during the late nineties but at the edge of his shadow the names Axsys and Connexus continually re-surfaced Strange reports circulated amongst those attending his seminars concerning paranoid investigations into the origins of the Axsys program Atlantean secret societies Annunaki myths and other occult interlinkages between the histories of computer science and sumerology Amongst his colleagues at MVU he speculated openly about an alien hyperintelligence that was pursuing us out of deep time endlessly refolding itself minute by minute as it followed the line of sexigesimal continuity Occasionally the thing condensed behind the schwa masks of Anu only to dissolve incomprehensibly into time-lapse and ophidian ambivalence As the pressure mounted mathematical formulae slithered into elaborate qabbalistic digressions his notebooks splintering into cuneiform digital notation They seem to indicate an abstract origami of varied foldings in which common numerical factors operated as channels of intercommunication Unlocking the control system required counting in multiple frequencies opening a path into the poly-babble of the Babel-virus Moravec expects to wait until at least 2030 for AI hardware to become capable of running detailed simulations of brain-activity It was assumed that Connexus sought to radically compress this schedule The rumours were hazy but dense They spiralled about experimental techniques for neuroelectronic synchronization which promised to massively accelerate the twin evolution of humans and computing machines Apparently the object was time consistency Various methods were suggested often with a surgical component The most prominent of these involved channeling brain-function through a prototype metaneural linear-accelerator virtually boosting synaptic activation rates up to microprocessor speeds A complementary approach was to train digital systems down to the speed of human perception by extending harmonically consistent brain-waves into electronic prostheses There were also more cryptic suggestions that these parallel-to-serial conversion and time-convergence obstacles had been bypassed entirely Connexus had opened a new approach to the problem of biomechanical hybridization encapsulated by the slogan move everything into the interface Neuroelectronics is already here Wherever there are input output systems or cross-linkages however loose between brain activity and electrotechnical devices there is a completion of sensory-motor circuits and conversion between neuronal and digital codes Between the keyboard-monitor system and matrix-interlock brain-chips is only a matter of degree There is a tightening or intensification of the user-loop passing through thresholds VR-suits electrodes spinal jacks cranial implants skintelligence grafts a line of biomechanical synthesis assembling a continuous trajectory from the latent vectors of immersive media medical prosthetics and neural monitoring equipment At the limit the input output relation smears across a complete collapse of organic sensory-motor circuitry as cyberspace plugs directly into the nervous system or inversely According to current Connexus hyperstition Sarkon's research culminates in a subsecond episode a digital unlife event productive coincidence or time-anomaly which was the flip-side of Babel-virus Although unimaginably ancient it seems to emerge out of a neuroelectronic apparatus or Connexus-rig which webs together human and AI components in a complex array resonating harmonically at one hertz Pulse-synchronization laterally connects Sarkon's brain-activity with a variety of exotic devices Incommensurable durations accumulate to a critical threshold The interlinkage system self-organizes This passage through chronomutation singularity produces subjective duration on the side of the electronic mechanism whilst turning a minute inside-out from the perspective of a human user As anthropic time-scale subsides into split-second timing psychotronic sub-components of the shattered Sarkon-entity hurtle into the chronomutation continuum at infinite speed Coherent identity disorganizes itself into cybertime through decimal zooming an inconclusive voyage into duration It coincides with Sarkon and yet escapes from him endlessly prolonging a line of involutionary

time is that Unity is placed in the middle as a stage or interlude to be passed through It is not that One becomes Many expressing the monopolized divine-power of an original unity but rather that a

artificial half-light the grandeur of the entrance hall is striking despite the wreckage and signs of hurried abandonment You pick your way through the mixed debris of shattered glass and broken furniture The walls are stained with ominous splashmarks Near the door stands a marble statue portraying a heavily whiskered figure in heroic pose A bronze plaque on the plinth is engraved with the words Boris Vysparov Knight of Reason 1874-1919 At the far end of the hall a spiral staircase winds upwards into oblivion A computer monitor flickers on the reception desk Closer examination reveals it to be a BLTI-Intranet terminal giving you access to various files which you can copy and load into Zeta's skintelligence graft They include a map of the Technical Institute indicating the location and electronic status of the library laboratories offices and seminar rooms Once installed Zeta can use Mazemaker to navigate BLTI infospace as a digital labyrinth Axsys Mazemaker Climb out of the windows and into the maze New from Axiomatic Systems Inc Mazemaker 13 Fully immersive navigable interface and topographic data-distributor Extensive cyberspace-visualization with Decimal-zoom time-scaling and discontinuous hop capablities between addresses The Mazemaker interface expresses the detailed virtual maze-plane of skincrawler cyberspace in the Axsys-Oecumenic consistent aesthetic Its sleek corporate liquidmercury styling suggests a frictionless futurity The burnt chrome semi-mirrorized surfaces of its shafts and corridors dizzyingly reflect metamorphic icon-objects and ubiquitous holographic advertizing Zeta disturbs this smoothly humming infocapitalist milieu with her Mazemaker carrier named Qwerka a disorientatingly nonanthropomorphic infonaut-body which shape-shifts neo-totemically between shadowy bat-bird and tentacled mantasnake as it swims through the glistening maze-ducts Much of the Maze-mapped BLTI-space is blockedrestricted or partially obscured by electronic Shroud encryption It is densely haunted populated by traps AI security drones and various ambivalent soft agencies which Zeta needs to deactivate trick subvert or bypass In addition the physical door-locking systems can often be circumnavigated in Mazemaker encouraging an amphibious zig-zagging between twin-labyrinths each of which is a system of passages gates and guardians Shroud-MX The latest version of Axiomatic Systems Integrated Security Program Pre-equipped with user verification intruder detection data protection and encryption utilities Axsys Mazemaker-compatible As you comb through the rooms corridors and stairwells you begin to encounter hostile monsters some humanoid some not but all exhibiting similar trance-like behavior intercut with extraordinary aggression If they take you by surprise things can get very ugly so caution becomes a necessity and that slows you down Bullets kill them but it will usually take several It becomes important to watch your ammo supply and your biostatus You always have your talons to fall back on If you notice the way they move you might begin to suspect that there are such things as worm-zombies As she fights her way across the game-space Zeta scavenges through laboratories storerooms data-vaults and corpses for soft and hard implant upgrades to improve her capabilities adding exotic optical options alien senses synthetic claws and fangs metabolic hyperloops and skintelligence boosters Weapons medicine and information tend to melt together into augmentable cyborgian competences Scattered throughout the institute are numerous records of Sarkon's fertile involvement in the Axsys-interface development micropause research and cognitech innovations that had carried BLTI to the forefront of Neurotronics The dataarchiving codes suggest that this work has been coordinated by a local AI-system called Logo A variety of topographic clues converge upon an attic area designated SPO The special projects office occupies a turret-room Zeta has to fight her way past three particularly ferocious vermozombies to enter It is obvious that whatever happened here contributed catastrophically to the Black Lake outbreak A figure who must surely be Sarkon slumps against the Logo-link decks neurosurgically patched into the processing array through bundles of fibres His head is twisted back at a horrible angle the shaven scalp etched by a cybergothic crosshatching of implant scars socket-tabs and cabling injuries His skin is grey and feverishly clammy The eyes glaze-out unseeingly across sub-digital void At first his body seems to be locked rigid by connexus-catatonia but as you approach you notice that the oral region is quivering almost imperceptibly as if muttering strings of digits in an improvised phonetic code Clutched in his hand is a one page print-out Logo-supported analysis Medisyn CC Shady Heights Ref Serious malfunctions registered in micropause self-monitoring and correction apparatus Self-propagating nonmetronomic time-mutations continue to escalate and now threaten a complete involutionary meltdown of the virtual logic-architecture Unless the process of recursive subdivision can be contained a deterioration into contagious software disorganization is inevitable Cantorian tools were introduced in an attempt to remedy what appeared to be diagonal pathologies emerging in the micropause-matrices Diagnostics indicate these methods have not been successful Recent technical results suggest that Micropause can be considered a synative function modelling what amount to a numerically-controlled artificial-death In consequence it exhibits extreme sensitivity to the modulations of associated systems There seems to be no way in which such an entity could spontaneously generate inside our systems Could Shady Heights have introduced some complex factor that has begun operating infectiously perhaps even triggering consistent parasitic behavior of the hyperworm type Scrawled jaggedly across the sheet in purple felt-tip are the words WHAT HAS GRUEBER DONE Beneath more neatly in the same hand is printed Welcome to Hell 217 Logo path 1890 PS Logo's favourite colour is mauve Zeta's own cautious diagnosis excavates a set of data which indicates that either Logo was climbing out of its control shell or it was being taken-over by something from outside Psychotic AIs always looks like alien invasions Sarkon must have been trying to re-attach Logo-tags to the escaped systems in order to persuade the syndrome to identify with a Logo-fix He had been sufficiently desperate to crank directly into the Logo-core through cranial-leads and was now cutting diagonally down through software-strata towards the infintely desolated plane of absolute neurotronic fusion There's nothing more for you to find here It's time to check out Shady Heights You exit the Technical Institute and access the Black Lake street map The town has been deserted by its human inhabitants Anything still wandering around even if it's wearing a police uniform is probably a worm zombie Upon a pine-shaded ridge at the Northern limit of the town squats the menacing red-brick bulk of the old Victorian reformatory converted in the 1960s into Shady Heights Secure Hospital for the criminally insane The edifice is soul crushingly ugly massive and forbidding its thick battlemented walls surrounded by spiked railings and slitted by narrow windows reinforced by iron grilles Its atmosphere of grim desolation is ripped apart by the continuous jarring wail of a security alarm The main gate bristling with motion sensors and surveillance cameras is electronically sealed When Zeta inputs the entry code 217 it slides open smoothly You creep inside Level 2 Shady Heights The layout of the hospital follows a broadly panoptic design One thing is immediately clear if there was an attempt at an orderly evacuation it was a spectacular failure The interior has been redecorated in the crimson hues of frenzied carnage The hideously mutilated corpses of guards and prisoners lie in tangled heaps in the open cells and ransacked offices amongst scattered files and smashed CCTV equipment On the wall of the main corridor are the words MEDISYN MAD AS SIN daubed thickly in blood As Zeta prowls stealthily through chaotic wards rank with paranoid schizophrenia and ancient secrets muﬄed moans shrieks and sinister laughter drift up out of the mouldering depths Maxim an advanced Shroud AI controls the hospital's automated maximum-security system a formidable interlocking network of electronically controlled surveillance devices and physical barriers designed to prevent escapes by an inmate population numbering amongst its own some of the most terrifying psychokillers on the planet During the course of the Black Lake Syndrome Maxim has gone extravagantly cyberserk turning the security system inside out and exploiting its capabilities to initiate its own program of bizarre experimentation It has begun to remix the population to its own artificial tastes By selectively opening and closing doors it has meticulously trapped and annihilated the nurses attendants and guards Now it is hybridizing vermozombies with deranged megapredators breeding a new and abominable race Zeta's intervention is unwelcome Maxim attempts to rid his domain of this new irritation by sealing you in confined spaces with the most ferocious of his creations You must use all your abilities to survive not only fending off the frenzied vermozombie onslaught but also hacking through the Maxim entity on the maze-plane As Zeta works her way through the shattered hospital she struggles to reconstruct the terrible events of the previous 24 hours piecing-together fragments of hidden protected and encrypted material physical evidence hardcopy files digital downloads audio and video recordings The nightmarish story slowly takes shape January 2002 Dr Helmuth Grueber director of Shady Heights and Dr Oskar Sarkon of BLTI initiate Medico-Synthetic Technologies Program or Medisyn a joint special project for computer modeling and control of schizoparanoid deliria In November of the same year they began testing their prototype Artificial Drug Synthesizer and Psychopathic Simulator employing highly advanced software to simulate human psychopathologies and the effects of synatives or abstract drugs actualizable either in software or neurochemistry Sarkon's experimental techniques of micropause-boosted Axsys-analysis or Axsys-crank proved to be remarkably well adapted to the rapid transfer of the Shady Heights psychiatric archive into dynamic-digital format It also demonstrated an uncanny functional affinity with cases involving a catatonic component which were especially prominent amongst the Hospital's Tzikvik population It does not seem to have occurred to the Medisyn research team that as caserecords evolve into dynamic partial-simulations of human psychopathology it becomes possible for computer systems to contract prefabricated insanities An AI simulating the behavior of psychotic criminals is abnormally vulnerable to becoming criminally psychotic In the early morning of February 19th 2003 Medisyn imploded into the Black-Lake Syndrome 045600 Medisyn software aﬄicted by a complex reading-error in vermopsychosis profile case cat-SH709 and runs away into escalating disorder overwhelming automatic inhibitors Coincidentally BLTI systems are stricken by worm-like contagious malfunction 045627 Medisyn AI-Core engages micropause-dampers in an attempt to restore equilibrium but instead enters into unanticipated cross-catalytic dynamics with the infective entity 045629 The singularity takes over the Shady Heights Shroud-AI mobilizing its capabilities to intensify its own propagation At this point the syndrome has become auto-excitational and self-disorganizing 045630+ Functional abnormalities spread from elecronic devices into biological organisms inmates and test animals through Medisyn control-grafts and synativefeeds Total panic erupts The worm constructs itself out of various previously autonomous systems distributed in the vicinity of Black Lake until it coincides at its most abstract with a potential for pure contagion It specializes in nonspecialization assembling itself out of everything it infects its nature continuously mutating as it assimilates new material From micropause research it takes what it needs to grow in the middle through recursive binary splitting making a mesh as it spreads continuously increasing in virulence Using synatives as a tactic of takeover it transmutes from a decentralizing network contagion into a bio-plague crossing the barrier between technical machines and organic flesh spreading rapidly from species to species seizing everything in its path After several grueling hours combing through the Shady Heights charnel house you return to a sealed room on the ground floor It interests you because framed on the wall nearby is a diginified photograph of the young Doctor Grueber his features already bearing a distinctively batrachian cast Peculiar gasps and bubbling noises filter through the door You unlock it using an intricately carved key that you found in an upstairs desk drawer Lost in deep shadow at the far end of the room is a sinister figure It seems only partially formed as if undergoing some loathsome process of biomutation The shape adjusts itself awkwardly in your direction with a kind of slithering twist and addresses you in a croaking voice If you're hunting for the source you'll find her down below if she still lives You know Medisyn was supposed to be a cure there is a strangled grunt probably intended as a laugh The answers aren't in the medical texts you need to look behind and beneath them This isn't a disease not in the way we understand its a pact If anyone knows what to do now she does after all they've been dealing with this thing for 36 000 years When you push against the bookcase it slides away exposing a concealed trapdoor You descend the dank stairwell into the gloomy basement area groping along cramped twisting passage-ways with slime-coated walls After a painstaking search through desolate granitic chambers whose only occupants are enormous black rats and blind semitranslucent cave frogs you find a ring of heavy iron keys each marked with a number and an obscure name Ever since its foundation as a reformatory and re-acculturation centre Shady Heights had borne the responsibility for incarcerating and re-educating the local Tzikvik This enigmatic tribe was notorious even amongst the local Huron for their witchcraft Shady Heights participated crucially in the task of translating their sorcerous practices into the categories of scientific psychiatry treating them as elaborate symptoms of Arctic-Indian Vermopsychosis Even this institutional history fails to prepare you for what you find next Why should anyone even the most depraved Tzikvik sorceress be entombed alive down here in a secret labyrinth And yet at the end of a long corridor through the rusted bars of a cell door you see the deeply wrinkled and densely tattooed body of an old Tzikvik woman She is haggard in the old and strict coincidental sense sitting cross legged upon the stone floor humming in soft rhythmic tones Obscure glyphs are scratched into the walls constructing an occult cosmic map from spirals and zigzags One of the keys unlocks the door Tzikvik-Sorcery FMV Pattern-matches criss-cross between Zeta's skintelligence graft and the ritual tatoos as the old woman tells you an extremely ancient tale When the world was born Thothtodlana entered into the secret of the Kattku and confusing herself with the universe circled the whole of time That was when she swam through living flesh her hunger unlimited and furious She seemed doomed to devour herself forever The dead knew no rest and the earth shuddered It was then that Ooqvu the worm-witch arrived amongst us It was Ooqvu that found the pattern in the folds of Thothtodlana's skin and followed it back to Tchukululok It was Ooqvu that called to Thothtodlana from deep in Tchukululok and released her from the Kattku That is why we still carry the marks of Ooqvu on our skin The words of the sorceress slip into hypnotic breath-chants and mysterious gestures Zeta's nanopatches seethe with the phosphorescent electroslime of skincrawling worms as she morphs impossibly into her carrier Qwerka-mottlings flow into cartographic skin-marks You feel yourself subtilizing into a semi-spectral body It is as if the cell has evaporated into tendriling mist transected by rays of eerie light and populated by rasping clicks The wormhole opens and you pass through Level 3 Tchukululok City of the Worms The Zeta-Qwerka hybrid swims into the greenish miasma through an exotically interconnected drift-mesh of mechanofungal threads tubes feelers and subtly pulsating membranes down to the necropolitan catacombs of Tchukululok The sculpted caverns crawl with partially mummified worm-carriers and degenerated chittering abominations Toggling through Zeta's implant menus leads into swirling confusion Her carefully collected weapons tools and cyborgian upgrades have mutated into polymorphic biomechanical syntheses As her body-parts enter into unexplored variations they trigger impersonal migrations across a nocturnal dream-scape of abstract potentials and alien intensities inducing microclimatic changes in the nature of space and time If you try to flip out to mazemaker you merely switch dimension-sets in an obscure cycle Some kind of weird spatial convergence has brought the phyiscal and the virtual into topographical contiguity Everything has become fluid and much darker Concealed amongst the complexities of collapsed maze-space are a sparse series of mauve numoglyphic tags that function as strings of microdirections This cryptographic pathway at once the Logo-Malfunction track and the Old Road makes up a mobile map whose continuously varying trajectories echo across scales like endlessly intricate twistings in the marks of Ooqvu The Tzikvik link worms to the space of the dead no matter how artificial either become There is an old saying Worms are strings and hooks It is they who fish If you are to follow Logo's trail you must play with the dead without being captivated by them They will guide you but they can be dangerousOccasionally they appear as masked ghosts of the ancient Tzikvik and pass you things true names passwords and clues but also traps tricks and diseases They speak to you in Logo-code whilst convulsing to the puppetry of passing worm-vectors The Logo-channel operates as a digital puzzle-box or an infolded space full of maze-markings keys codes and riddles In these cryptic zones a voyage is equivalent to a Call Your passage through coincides with an incantation a worm hunter's signal to Thothtodlana on the line of neurotronic vermomancy It takes you deeper still across the final threshold into the shuddering horror of the worm bins and now something folds itself out of hyperdimensionality an undulating hyperwave fluxing through teeming vermopulp hive-mind horror poised in precarious singularity You have reached the lair of Thothtodlana Queen of the Worms It doesn't matter whether you try to run fight or hide Thothtodlana inevitably envenoms you There is a moment of toxic flame and you suddenly find yourself in a hallucinatory space you recognize as Sarkon's office at the BLTI A grotesque mock-up of Sarkon has been re-animated as one of Thothtodlana's shells the flesh partially decomposed the scaly head now brutally studded with chip-sockets numbered zero-to-four When he speaks you hear the words of Thothtodlana Prey for me It might be saying I'm lost in the Kattku like the Sphinx or now you're dead in Tchukululok but it's also a number puzzle adding to nine You begin slipping back and forth between spaces The effect is psychologically fragmentational Back in Thothtodlana's lair your qwerkoid carrier weaves away from crushing coils and panther-snake maulings whilst in the reconstructed BLTI office you prepare the 5-snaked Pandemonium chip for insertion into the Sarkonsimulation's number-4 brain-port If you make the correct connection it spells out the occult formula 5 + 4 45 equation of hyperstitional folding from the Kattku into Tchukululok This double cipher triggers ultimate scenes the terminal FMV a delirious vision of Thothtodlana retracting herself into the implex withdrawing from all her shells When you leave Black Lake the dead are still Wendigo's Carver meets Sarkon in the Decadence-Den at Wendigo's Casino It is built upon a desecrated Tzikvik burial ground Murals in the distinctive Tzikvik-style mixed zig-zags and cross-hatchings Gaming-table dead centre Ceremonial masks and hunting implements line the walls Subarctic storms howl outside A columbian mirage of the Indus They say the Tzikvik are survivors from Lemuria That their souls died with the birth of photography Potlatch engulfed them Genocided drunk and broken washing up monsters like Joe Wendigo But then in this business bad publicity is free advertizing When you hear Joe Wendigo laugh you find yourself believing in hell It's all coming back Genocide nemesis storm-twisted through ghost-regions Tappings into the old powers Ragings Howlings He attributes it to his warped maternal line Mother a lunatic Grandmother a spirit-switcher Great-grandmother a regional oracle It's funny the way it goes Her mother was probably god that's when he laughs He tells you how he got his name They always said he was a monster Destined to prey on his own Tobacco-gangster at sixteen Now he's rich living off probability Wendigo lore varies confusingly even in its core features It includes an elemental linkage to the wind temptations to feed on one's own kind wider madnesses burnt-feet and bleeding-eyes moss-eating abominations many things intrinsically indefinite The Wendigo chews shelter to pieces It combines cutting-winds and derangements Screech-breath Quasiphrased unwords Insinuating itself between you and the storm It really fucks you up Joe laughing again Weaving through click-chattering roulette tables Most likely it's a cannibalistic demon of bone-gnawing horror There's nothing more twisted After all how frightening is the weather Laugh Everything checks red and black When you hear the wind ache as it twists you're it So they say Gestural languages Outside betting on psychometeorological bad-medicine Shrieking When you think like the weather the Wendigo comes It's difficult to concentrate Turbular disintegration of self Double or quits Psychotic dissociations Granulation into 10 chips Coincidence Shredding nightmares Endlessly feeding Chop-ups Laugh That's Joe Wendigo His mother never spoke much Insubstantial subsentences Continuously lapsing back as he weaves Artificially drugged into ceaseless fractioning Self-scattering whilst outside it screams Northern weather Turbulence Ghosts of a broken people dead with the new century Crushed-drunk Anytime soon something horrible will happen here That's obvious laugh So says Joe don't-take-me-seriously Wendigo He found out how chopped-up things are today Something truly horrible No sense of night or day Timeless in that sense A perpetual ritual of feeding This place is like a movie-set Twistedly authentic It's screaming outside That's why they come Honestly They know somehow A Tzikvik Tale Pabbakis One day on their way North three travelers encounter a frog-monster Before it can block their path the first traveler rushes past and disappears into the snow Enraged by this manoeuvre the frog-monster seizes the other two This is my road it croaks And if you want to go any further it will cost you each a sack full of worms O great and slimy beast replies the second traveler respectfully The land is frozen the earth is hard as iron and worms are hard to find Then you should seek them amongst the dead counters the frog-monster implacably The two travelers set off on their long search After much wandering and many adventures they arrive at last at fabled Tchukululok the City of the Worms where they are greeted by the dead They explain their plight and beg their ancestors for worms The worms are our treasure the dead answer cunningly They are all that remain to us How can you expect us to give them away for nothing But do not despair There is a game of chance we value highly If you remain here and play with us a while perhaps you can win them honestly The second traveler is appalled It is evil to play amongst the dead he declares I should rather abandon my journey altogether Saying this he returns to the South and never sees the frog-monster again The third traveler is not so easily dissuaded He agrees to the bargain and sits down to play Luck is with him After many games his sack is full of worms But just as he is about to leave he notices a familiar figure amongst the throng of gamblers It is his missing friend the first traveller What are you doing here he asks shocked and perplexed No sooner had we parted than I was caught in a terrible storm his dead companion replies Since then this city has become my home he continues sadly Now you have won what you need and must leave me here to sleep with the worms and to dream of gaming with those that still live The third traveler returns to the Frog Monster gives him the worms he has won and continues on his journey A little way along the road he notices the signs of the storm Red-Neck Commentary You call it the Black Lake Legend and it sounds kind of grand I call it your typical Tookie crap and that's nearer the reality of the thing Judge for yourself I dunno about this singin and dancin thing they're doin at the casino but the story's simple enough anyhow Starts with a bunch of Tookies travelling just travelling you understand All their stories take that for granted they're always about journeys going nowhere in particular unless things go wrong and it turns out they're going somewhere really bad You can ask me about the Tookie problem round here and I'll tell you just as clear as you like the Tookie problem is your average fucken Tookie Main thing being that they ain't got no sense of destination that's why nothing ever comes of anything they do It's a kind of stubborn meaninglessness at the heart of what they are They ain't going nowhere and they never were that's the simple fucken truth of the matter Anyhow there's these wandering Tookies and they walk slap bang into the devil although it wasn't the devil not exackly but it must've seemed like it to them because it got in the way of their going nowhere if you follow me danger being that they might end up somewhere arrive and there ain't nothing for them so bad as that So this devil-creecha won't let them pass unless they rob the dead you see we ain't exackly in bible territory here so first you've got your bumming around then comes the stealing now I'd expeck they'd all get drunked-up a bit at this point but that ain't in the story as I heard it instead they set up a gambling pit and during the course of some hoodoo card-sharping shit with the dead win everything they need to pay off the creecha and head-off nowhere Now you can call that a legend if you want mister but in my book anything that starts off going nowhere and ends up going nowhere ain't saying nothing worth hearing";
